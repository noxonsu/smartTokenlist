    "summary": "Who is Bully Maguire? - Bully Maguire is the most powerful being in the universe. He possesses presumably all of the same powers as the prime Spider Man, as well as awesome (or even godlike) strength, stamina and durability. But perhaps his most terrifying power is his mastery of emotional, psychological, and verbal abuse. He also has an unlimited supply of dirt which he uses to blind his opponents. He also has the power to change hairstyle and clothing at will. He is also shown to be able to traverse the Multiverse at will in order to pick on new victims. No projectiles, or magic works on Bully Maguire, he just grabs it with a web and throws it back. You are forced to get up close and personal with this fight, and drive that funky soul.\n\n  - \n\n"
