    "summary": "Introducing Private Transactions On Ethereum NOW! - By default, your entire Ethereum transaction history and balances are public. All transactions can be seen on block explorers like Etherscan. Thereby literally anyone who knows that you own a particular address can easily view your payments, trace the source of your funds, calculate your holdings, and analyze your on-chain activity. But what if you did not want your history and balances to be publicly viewed by any Tom, Dick, or Harry? What if you wanted anonymity and privacy when it came to your transactions?\n\n"
