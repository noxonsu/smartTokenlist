This is only available for buyers. Sellers can\u2019t cancel the contract, as long as you do not miss any final monthly payment deadline(s). When you opt to cancel a transaction, the received installments will be kept by the seller. You won\u2019t receive the ownership of the domain and the domain will be returned to the original seller.\n\n Long term service fee - Long term service fee is a fee percentage added when you pick a period longer than 1 year.
