    "summary": "Pepe's first appearance - Furie created the anthropomorphic amphibian character Pepe the Frog around 2004, first appearing as a character in his zine _Play Time_ in single-pane comics created using Microsoft Paint. The character was a \"peaceful frog-dude\" with three animal roommates.\n\n It all started many years ago when artist Matt Furie was drawing frogs for fun while on the job at a thrift shop in San Francisco - He created a small comic strip called Playtime and named his character Pepe.\n\n"
