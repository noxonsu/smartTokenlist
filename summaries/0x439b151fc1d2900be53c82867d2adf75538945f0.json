    "summary": "Spooling Up\u2026 - Yield for the World. Fuel for DeFi.\n\n Decentralised Finance should be a simple deal between The People and The Protocols. - Lending Platforms, Automated Market Makers, and other DeFi protocols want liquidity to put to work. Everyone else wants their money to work for them and earn a competitive yield. This seemingly obvious match is blocked by small inefficiencies that create a barrier, preventing the majority of capital from being productive. Spool removes this barrier and allows anyone to engage with DeFi on their own terms in a single deposit. No compromises. Absolute simplicity. Banks and traditional investment products are increasingly proving too inflexible to take on the financial challenges society faces in the 21st century. Spool ensures that anyone can put their capital to work today, and to build products that help millions of others do the same tomorrow. Whatever your financial goals are, Spool has you covered. No lockups, no sneaky fees, no nasty surprises.\n\n The world of DeFi is thriving with hundreds of different protocols competing for liquidity to use in the most productive manner possible. - Spool is the simplest way to discover, access, and combine the best options in this vast space to make sure all liquidity goes wherever it is most aligned with its owner\u2019s personal terms. Users get the yield they want. DeFi Protocols get the liquidity they need. Spool makes sure it stays that way.\n\n Spool is a DAO. Unseen by the masses, we work tirelessly in the background to ensure that our users always have access to the best risk adjusted yield available while fueling protocols with the liquidity they need. Spool is a benevolent entity that ensures the growth and wellbeing of DeFi as a whole. - Join the Spool DAO today and help shape the path toward a more accessible and fair financial system tomorrow.\n\n"
