    "summary": "The Muse with A Tail of Furbabies - Ryan Cohen, a bright-eyed entrepreneur with a penchant for the peculiar, was inspired by his teacup poodle, Tylee Inu. An unassuming moment at a local pet store, while merely shopping for Tylee's dinner, sparked an idea. The spark? A premium, grain-free meal that made Tylee's tail wag with unprecedented enthusiasm. This moment of joy from Tylee led Ryan to wonder why such high-quality meals were not more accessible and why pet food couldn't be delivered directly to pet parents' doors with the same ease as human groceries. Seeing his furry friend's delight, Ryan was driven to ensure no pet parent would have to compromise on the quality or accessibility of their pet\u2019s nutrition. He envisioned a world where quality pet care was just a click away, which led to the creation of Chewy. Tylee Inu wasn't just the inspiration behind the name; she was the muse for the entire operation. Chewy quickly grew from a fledgling startup into a pet supply empire, transforming the way pet owners shopped for food, toys, and accessories. Ryan's story is a testament to how observing the simple needs of a beloved pet can lead to groundbreaking ideas in entrepreneurship. It\u2019s a tale that continues to inspire and a reminder of the profound impact our furry friends have on our lives and careers.\n\n"
