On-chain launches are quite a different beast with a ton of coordination needed between infrastructure partners, and education of new concepts for users (slippage, gas, network congestions, price curves).\n\nJupiter is pushing it to the limit with more than 1 million users & bots claiming & trading at the same time \u2014 join us in the pioneering mess & pave the way for future projects to launch on-chain!\n\nUnder the hood: DLMM pool\n\nWe are using a custom single-sided Meteora DLMM pool as a novel mechanism to bootstrap early liquidity. It has a low inital price for rapid price discovery and to attract immediate USDC liquidity for paper paws to dump. It also provides early backstop liquidity that the team cannot withdraw. 100% transparent and on chain, no drama.\n\nHow do I buy $JUP?\n\nYou may set up Limit Orders & DCA Orders before $JUP goes live, and we will try to fill your orders when trading begins.\n\nAfter trading has begun, you can also claim your airdrop allocation and swap as usual.\n\nShould I use Limit Orders or DCA?\n\nLimit Orders are very useful if you know exactly the price you want to buy $JUP at. DCAs are useful if you want to spread your orders out over-time, and accumulate JUP without being particular about price.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to Jupiter\u2019s DCAs & LOs, ask us in Discord!\n\nHow do I use priority fees on Jupiter?\n\nJupiter has a Market Fee footer, at the bottom of this page. View the current fees others are paying for various actions on Jupiter. You can then set a Max Fee, and Jupiter will intelligently change the fee to land your transactions.\n\nYou can even set an Exact Fee override to default to the fee you chose.\n\nTake note for LO & DCA, these fees only apply for opening and not filling orders.\n\nCurrent priority fees\n\nClaim0.0001 SOL\n\nSwap0.0001 SOL\n\nCreate Limit/DCA0.0001 SOL\n\nMax Cap\n\nExact Fee\n\n(~)\n\nSave\n\nJupiter intelligently decides the best fee for you.
