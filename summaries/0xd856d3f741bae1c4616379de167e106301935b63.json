Polyhedra Network provides trustless and highly- efficient interoperability solutions for asset transfers, message passing, and data sharing between various Web2 and Web3 systems.\n\n ZK Full-stack for Web3 - Interoperability Polyhedra Network implements infrastructures for Web3 interoperability across heterogeneous systems which guarantee strong security without extra trust assumptions. Scalability Polyhedra Network designs and develops scalable and efficient zero-knowledge proof protocols for large-scale ZKP systems with distributed computing networks. Fine-grained Privacy Polyhedra Network provides fine-grained privacy extensions for Web3 with stealth address models, meeting both privacy-preserving needs and compliance policies.\n\n Products - zkBridge zkBridge Mainnet Alpha is live. Our zkBridge provides trustless and efficient cross-chain infrastructures for the layer-1 and layer-2 interoperability by using deVirgo, a novel distributed proof system. zkLightClient Integration with zkLightClient by using zero-knowledge proof technology will enhance security, performance, and cost-efficiency for cross-chain interoperability on all chains supported by LayerZero. ZK-DID The ZK-DID is a verifiable credential system which is secure, interoperable, scalable and easy-to-use. We protect users' privacy with advanced zero- knowledge proofs that can be used for both Web2 and Web3 scenarios. ZK-NFT ZK-NFT is a programmable NFT protocol with dynamic asset and data containers, realizing maximum interoperability. ZK-NFT is powered by zero-knowledge proofs with stealth address models to protect privacy of related assets.\n\n"
