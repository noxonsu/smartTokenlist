    "summary": "YardBoyz - YardBoyz is a Hybridized NFTxDeFi collection containing 10,000 inmates housed at ADX Florence. For each full $YBOYZ token purchased, an NFT will be minted to your account. Based on DN404's very gas efficient ERC-X contract - the YardBoyz development team has taken the liberty to add a couple of changes, while fixing a few bugs on the contract along the way - we're calling this upgrade ERCYB. Our modification of DN404 includes staking and taxes - which are used for development and providing yield to our stakers.\n\n Devs - The YardBoyz dev team has been working together for the past 4 years, and has twenty-five years of combined crypto experience. We're composed of four developers, and quite a few of our marketing buddies are along for the ride. We've worked at Google, Amazon and other big tech companies. Our team members have launched many successful projects, with one of our teammate's biggest successes hitting 1.2B ATH. We've launched many successful novel protocols, with one of our countracts being re-used more than 5,000 times (in some way shape or form).\n\n Marketing - Some of our friends who've helped launch the project!\n\n Community - YardBoyz, first and foremost is a community. A community of alpha hunters, expert NFT minters, and professional developers. And we want YOU! Although there are plans for the project - they won't be revealed until our community is formed to avoid speculative buying.\n\n"
