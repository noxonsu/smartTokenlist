    "summary": "What's the $Peepo scoop ? - Peepo, affectionately known as Pepo, is a beloved offshoot of the Pepe the Frog meme. Inspired by the Apu Apustaja meme from Finnish imageboards, Peepo is like Pepe\u2019s lil\u2019 bro. Despite his somewhat crudely drawn appearance, Peepo is adorably derpy and endearingly clumsy, capturing a range of emotions through various emotes.\n\n"
