    "summary": "origin of pierre the french frog - In the heart of picturesque Provence, there lived a frog named Pierre. Unlike his amphibian counterparts, Pierre had a certain sophistication about him. With a tiny beret atop his head and a penchant for sipping espresso by the riverside, he was truly a frog of refined tastes. Pierre's days were spent leisurely hopping along the banks of the tranquil river that meandered through the village. He would often pause to admire the vibrant blooms of the nearby gardens or engage in spirited debates with the resident snails about the finer points of French literature.\n\n"
