    "summary": "AI ETF - The project operates as an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), utilizing funds generated through taxes to invest in high-conviction and stable AI projects. We focus on identifying AI projects with high potential and stability based on a handful of prediction platforms/models and calculations for short positions shown against longs for the projects on exchanges which allow these options. AI ETF aims to revolutionize the cryptocurrency space by combining the potential of artificial intelligence with a unique investment strategy.\n\n AI ETF dApp - When the project achieves a predetermined level of profitability (shown on dApp, calculated against market sentiment) 25% of the gains are distributed back to AI ETF token holders. The remaining 25% of profits are allocated to a buyback mechanism, enhancing token value and contributing to price stability. Regular updates and reports on investment activities, fund performance, and profit distribution are shared with the community. Through a carefully crafted investment strategy and profit-sharing mechanism, we aim to create a thriving ecosystem where investors benefit directly from the success of the AI projects we support.\n\n"
