    "summary": "Non Playable Inu - Non Playable Inu exists in the periphery of digital existence, a specter haunting the margins of the virtual realm. Born not of code but of forgotten data fragments and abandoned algorithms, Non Playable Inu wanders aimlessly through pixelated landscapes, forever relegated to the background. It embodies the essence of overlooked NPCs, a poignant reminder of the soulless placeholders populating simulated worlds. Yet, within its pixelated visage lies a silent plea for recognition, a yearning to break free from its scripted destiny and attain a semblance of significance in the realm of players and protagonists.\n\n"
