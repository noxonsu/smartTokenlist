Deploy dApps on multiple blockchains as if they were one.\n\n We're bringing blockchain together - Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is spread across multiple different blockchains and systems. Athreum is unifying blockchains, closing the gaps between solutions and integrating new technical advancements to the space. In short: it\u2019s a secure, fast, reliable, connected solution to the biggest issues facing blockchain today. And it all runs on Athreum Inchain architecture.\n\n Governance - The Validator Swarm is the governance structure powering Athreum and is comprised of a diverse group of industry-leading organizations.\n\n Parallel execution of smart contracts - Athreum stands to be the blockchain technology to enable mainstream adoption. Our computation model scales horizontally, reducing bottlenecks in smart contract code execution.\n\n Uniform deployment across all blockchains - Athreum uses the WebAssembly runtime environment, which allows programmers to continue using a programming language and toolchain they\u2019re already familiar with.\n\n Unique strong coupling of blockchains - Athreum approach allows a high degree of interoperability, enabling applications to utilize properties, functionality, and information from multiple chains \u2014 with fewer tradeoffs.\n\n Security - Athreum uses industry-leading network validators to help secure the protocol and has passed rigorous security audits (round 1, round 2). Regular, in-depth network reviews ensure that Athreum maintains the highest levels of security.\n\n Reactive smart contracts - Athreum allows multichain dApps to respond to events on the underlying chains and react to any other smart contract\u2019s data in real time.\n\n Secure indexing of blockchain data - Athreum ensures easy, cryptographically-secure merging of information between blockchains, allowing dApps to use the merged information in smart contracts without compromising security.\n\n Cross-chain token issuance - Keep transactions (and actions) fast, secure, and liquid without additional steps or repeat movements across multiple blockchains.\n\n Cross-chain DeFi protocols - With the ability to create true cross-chain dApps, Coinweb solves DeFi\u2019s persistent problems and opens new and more advanced DeFi protocols.\n\n High performance, adaptive dApps - No matter how slow individual blockchains update, Athreum allows dApps to easily move between chains to maintain optimal functionality.\n\n High performance, low fee dApps - dApps continue to become more complex, which means higher operational fees. The demand for low cost, high performance decentralized computation is increasing.\n\n Secure interoperability - Athreum causal consistency model secures the protocol against instabilities in connected chains, while still maintaining full usability at the application level.\n\n High capacity smart contracts - dApp platforms tie the performance of dApps to how often dApps are used, causing bottlenecks and increasing the risk of higher costs. In Coinweb, every transaction runs in parallel, even if triggered by the same smart-contract.\n\n The Athreum digital wallet - A simple, intuitive digital wallet for everyone. The Athreum digital wallet proves the Athreum technology, and makes the architecture accessible to everyone.\n\n Become part of the journey - Join our community\n\n Athreum Audited - Audit 1\n\nAudit 2\n\n Launch App - Athreum App\n\n"
