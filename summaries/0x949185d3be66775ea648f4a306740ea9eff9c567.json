    "summary": "Equilibrium - The community has decided to migrate from YEL to YEL v2 within a 30-day period. Act now to ensure you don't lose your YEL tokens, as migration will not be possible after this period. YEL v2 is powered by the Axelar Network, which provides Interchain Bridge capabilities, enabling quick expansion across different EVM chains. The new YEL token marks the beginning of an exciting journey.\n\n"
