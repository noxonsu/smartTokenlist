    "summary": "Momo - Lately, you can't scroll through Douban, Xiaohongshu, or Zhihu without bumping into a 'Momo.' This mysterious, pink dino-avatar-wielding account is popping up everywhere, leaving everyone scratching their heads\u2014who or what is Momo?\n\n Momo - 'Momo,' a default nickname and avatar originally auto-generated for new users. It wasn't supposed to be anyone specific. But people quickly realized that if you want to hide your identity, age, job, or whatever, why not just go with 'Momo'? Momo became the perfect alias for those who don\u2019t want to leave any traces, no likes, no comments and just pure, untraceable browsing.\n\n One Mo to Rule Them All - Momo isn\u2019t the first collective ID in the digital world. Remember the 'User Deleted' trend on Xiaohongshu? Or the 'Jianghu Scammer' nicknames on Douban? Momo is just the latest in a long line of digital masks.\n\n Momo - Some people have started using Momo as a shield to post rumors and engage in toxic behavior, thinking another Momo will take the blame. But remember, when one 'bad Mo' acts out, the whole 'Mo Army' takes the heat.\n\n Momo - Only holding $MOMO are the true defenders of the Momo name. If you don\u2019t have $MOMO, you\u2019re just an imposter in the Mo Army.\n\n Momo - The real ones know how to do.\n\n More \uff06 Mo - If got bored of the basic pink dino, let\u2019s gave it new faces, outfits, and bam.. 'Momo Universe' was born!\n\n MOMO \u00a9 2024 - \n\n"
