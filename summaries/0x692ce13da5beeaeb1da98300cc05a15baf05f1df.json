    "summary": "Feels Good Man - \"FeelsGoodMan\" is a popular internet meme and expression that originated from an image of a satisfied-looking frog named Pepe. The expression comes from the name of the meme itself, derived from a comic strip by artist Matt Furie called \"Boy's Club.\" Over time, Pepe evolved from his comic origins into a symbol used globally to express happiness, satisfaction, or irony.\n\n"
