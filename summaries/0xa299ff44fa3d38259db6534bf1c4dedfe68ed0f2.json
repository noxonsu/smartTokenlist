    "summary": "French Farmhouse Venue - The French Farmhouse Venue is an elegant estate that opened in September 2020. Nestled on 56-acres featuring beautiful oak trees, a covered bridge and a 3-acre lake in the Mountain Springs Community on the edge of Lake Ray Roberts! Located one hour north of Dallas and thirty minutes north of Denton. With our love of design, antiques and everything French we have designed and built the venue with the antiques we have found from all over the world. This one-of-a-kind French-inspired venue gives you a variety of indoor and outdoor options, including our newly constructed Chapel that opened in May 2022. Both the venue and Chapel are home to architectural rental pieces, vintage cars and a couple\u2019s prayer trail to make your wedding as special as you are!\n\n"
