    "summary": "SECURE MONEY MARKETS FOR ALL CRYPTO ASSETS - Silo is a non-custodial lending protocol to borrow any crypto asset with another.\n\n ISOLATED RISK - When you deposit in a Silo, you don't share the risk with other tokens in the protocol. Silos can only borrow the bridge asset from each other, keeping the risk isolated to a single Silo.\n\n SHARED LIQUIDITY - To concentrate liquidity, each token asset gets one Silo only. With the bridge asset connecting all Silos, liquidity moves fluidly in the protocol, enabling any collateral token to borrow another.\n\n INCLUSIVE. LIMITLESS - Silo is designed to support any token asset on the chains it operates on. Silos share default collateral factors that can be adjusted on a Silo level at any time.\n\n SECURITY & AUDITS - The security of the Silo protocol is always our highest priority.\n\n THE TEAM - Shadowy Edd, Ihor, Neo Racer, Tyko, Siros Ena, Andrew, Augustus, Aiham Jaabari, Yoshua Urioste, Nutoro D. Chutoro, Alex, Anton\n\n CAREERS - We are always looking for smart contract engineers and other talents.\n\n JOIN US - Join a fast-growing community building the next-generation lending protocol.\n\n"
