    "summary": "$COLON: The FATHER Doge - The space is maturing, and with it we pay homage and respects to those that came before us and made our favorite meme\u2019s what they are today. Professor Colon is undoubtedly a massive part of the lore and story that transformed our beloved and inexperienced little Pumpkin Kabosu into the Doge we all know and love. Without him she would hardly be the same meme or dog we\u2019ve all come to trust and adore\n\n"
