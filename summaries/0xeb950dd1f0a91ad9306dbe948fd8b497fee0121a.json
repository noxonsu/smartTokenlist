    "summary": "Put Your Money on Work Nonstop - CAP DAPP and Token functionality is Totally Decentralized with secured Trustless Mechanism\n\n About Us - Crypto Asset Pool is a simplified and secure partiCAPation in Staking, generating yield by interacting the Smart contract mechanism. CAP token has made a stealth launch on the most advance chain in the crypto which is ARBITRUM. Expanding the community by P2P networking with a mission to create a Giant space in the Blockchain Industry.\n\n Our Vision - We envision a future where decentralized finance is accessible to everyone, empowering individuals with simplified and secure partiCAPation in staking and yield generation. Our journey began with a mission to revolutionize the blockchain industry by introducing the CAP token through a stealth launch on the cutting-edge ARBITRUM chain.\n\n Our Mission - Our mission is to democratize access to decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing a simplified and secure gateway to staking and yield generation. We are driven by the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to partiCAPate in the blockchain revolution, regardless of their level of expertise or background.\n\n Our Speciality - Why CryptoAssetPool\n\n Arbitrum Chain Pools - CAP has 5 Liquidity pools on the Arbitrum one chain which will grow according to crypto bull trends.\n\n Stake to Earn - You can earn upto 300% in 25 Months by Staking your CAP tokens on our platform.\n\n Decentralized Networking - You can also earn by reffering & by creating P2P network upto 20 levels and earn more CAP.\n\n What is ARBITRUM ? - Arbitrum has just launched its native token which will probably be scale like other chains did in past. This can be the next x100 chain. One pool of CAP is paired with ARB token\n\n Lower Cost - Arbitrum\u2019s suite of scaling solutions provides faster speeds at a significantly lower cost, with the same level of security as Ethereum. One of Ethereum's most promising Layer-2 solutions is Arbitrum, which is designed to boost Ethereum's speed and scalability by securely offloading the bulk of the network's transaction validation processes to a second-layer blockchain.\n\n Fast & Secured - By moving most of the computation and storage load off-chain, Arbitrum enables higher throughput and lower fees compared to Ethereum. Additionally, Arbitrum benefits from Ethereum's security and compatibility, making it a secure and reliable solution for developers.\n\n Roadmap - The Journey of Crypto Asset Pool\n\n Concept - Idea Implementation, Creating Team\n\n Launch & Research - Creating Smart Contract, DEX Launch, Releasing Whitepaper\n\n Listing - Listing on Multiple Platforms, Make it More Accesible\n\n Team & Community - CMC & CG, Team Expansion, Community Events\n\n Pools - Creating more Liquidity Pools, CEX listing\n\n Global Partnerships Team - Advisory Expansion\n\n Frequently Aksed Questions - Please check this FAQ First before contacting us.\n\n What is dapp? - Decentralized applications (Dapp) are a piece of software which communicates with the blockchain, that manages the state of all network. The interface of the decentralized applications does not look different than any website. The smart contract represents the logic of a decentralized application. Smart contracts are integral building blocks of blockchains, which process information from external sensors or events and help the blockchain to manage the state of all\n\n How do they work? - DApps should not be practical as a DApp. They can be web pages, desktop or mobile apps which simply operate like any other application might. The application\u2019s data is not hosted on local or cloud servers, rather a network of nodes which maintains an exact ledger \u2013 this is a blockchain. Moreover, to explain clearly how DApps work, it means delving into the function of a blockchain. This can quickly become esoteric for those who not from a technical background.\n\n What are the benefits of dapp? - With a DApp, there are no centralized servers to store the data which is saved to the blockchain. Before blockchain, there is no organization that is liable for securing end-user data from the server and all. The data stored on the blockchain is highly secure. It can provide security, transparency, interoperability, easy access to data, high transaction speeds, and many more privileges.\n\n What are the features in dapps? - Dapps are decentralized are open source. The application stores its records on a public network and not on a centralized server. The code which governs this application has to be available to the public for examination. The developer support the code and can update the software constantly.\n\n Contact Us - Get in touch.\n\n Phone - +00 000 000 0000\n\n Email - cryptoassetpool@gmail.com\n\n Address - 1093 Flushing Abc, Dubai\n\n"
