    "summary": "Buy $NORMIE - Normie is a slang pejorative label for an individual who is deemed to be boringly conventional or mainstream by those who identify themselves as nonconformists. On 4chan's r9k (robot) board, it is often used to describe certain characters in greentext stories. Normies can be seen as the antithetic stereotype of hipsters and special snowflakes, both of which are derogatory terms for nonconformists.\n\n"
