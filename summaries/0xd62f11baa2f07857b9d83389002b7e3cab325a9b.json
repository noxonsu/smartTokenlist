    "summary": "Introduction - BitDAO aims to support builders of the decentralized economy. It is an open platform for proposals that are voted upon by BIT token holders.\n\n Governance - BitDAO is governed by $BIT token holders. It is permissionless to submit soft proposals on the BitDAO forum, and official proposals on the BitDAO Governance Module (Snapshot). It is permissionless to hold $BIT, delegate $BIT, and vote on proposals.\n\n Resource Management - The BitDAO treasury grows through net inflows from BIT powered products, the increasing value of assets held in the treasury or off-chain, and contributions from Bybit. The BitDAO treasury allocates resources to fund the development and adoption of BIT powered products, specialized initiatives, liquidity support and BIT purchase programs, and token swaps with other organizations.\n\n Principles - BitDAO is not a company. It does not have a management team or employees. BitDAO is a collection of builders and stakeholders who hold $BIT tokens and are motivated to make the project a success. Holding $BIT entitles holders to submit and vote on proposals. It does not entitle holders to impose their will upon other contributors. Partnerships or $BIT use-cases that are sponsored by others do not require a governance proposal.\n\n"
