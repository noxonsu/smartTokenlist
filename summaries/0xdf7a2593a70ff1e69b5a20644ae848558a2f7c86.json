Consider this website as a long thread about the rarities of the collection and important contributions of the community. The last paragraph is about myself, the creator of this website. I am a simple member of the mfers community, I am not sartoshi and I am not affiliated with him. The presented information were allocated with the best interest, but you should ensure that all of them are correct by yourself. Furthermore they resemble my subjective point of view. If you think something is missing, simply leave me a kind direct message on twitter and I will think about what you said. When in doubt, I will ask the community about your proposals or thoughts.\n\n The story of mfers - The story of mfers started with sartoshi, the creator of mfers. His original twitter account (sartoshi_nft) is no more, therefore I will put the pieces into order and give an outlook for the future and explain how sartoshi came back to the community with a new twitter account (@sartoshi_rip).\n\n"
