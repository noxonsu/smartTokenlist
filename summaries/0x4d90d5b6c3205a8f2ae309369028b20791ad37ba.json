    "summary": "KISHU INU - The Kishu, sometimes called Kishu Inu or Kishu dog, is a Japanese breed of dog. It is descended from ancient medium-sized breeds and named after the Kishu region, now Mie Prefecture and Wakayama Prefecture. It was designated a living national monument of Japan in 1934. One legend from the Kii peninsula states that the first boar dog, and the progenitor to the Kishu breed, was a Honshu Wolf pup gifted to a hunter when he showed compassion for an injured she-wolf.\n\n"
