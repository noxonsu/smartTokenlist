    "summary": "FLAT ERIC - Flat Eric is a puppet character, created by Quentin Dupieux, from Levi's commercials for Sta-Prest One Crease Denim Clothing, built by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. His name comes from an idea for a commercial that involved having a car run over his head and flattening it. The idea was not used, but the name stuck.\n\n"
