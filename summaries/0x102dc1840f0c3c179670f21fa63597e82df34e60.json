    "summary": "Hypervisor Nodes - These nodes act as the hypervisor or virtual machine monitor, overseeing the creation and management of virtual machines. They allocate resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each VM.\n\n Storage Nodes - Responsible for managing storage resources, these nodes handle the virtual disks and data storage associated with virtual machines.\n\n Network Nodes - Playing a pivotal role in networking, these nodes establish connections between virtual machines, allowing seamless communication and data transfer.\n\n Private Data Nodes - Focused on securing sensitive information within virtualized environments, these nodes handle encryption and decryption processes to safeguard data within virtual machines.\n\n Public Data Nodes - Managing non-sensitive information, these nodes facilitate communication and data exchange between virtual machines and external networks.\n\n Indexing Nodes - These nodes organize and index data within virtualized environments, optimizing data retrieval processes.\n\n API Nodes - Serving as the interface for communication between virtual machines and external systems or applications, these nodes enable seamless integration and interaction.\n\n"
