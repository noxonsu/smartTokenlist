    "summary": "Avatar Intelligence - AvI aims to realize the scenario imagined by the Brainiac films where human brain is uploaded to the Internet, or where a program identical to a user's brain is created on the Internet.\n\n Distribution of Neural Data on Brainiac Blockchain - Brainiac will build a general-purpose platform around Avatar Intelligence. Any user can use the tools on Brainiac to upload and store their brain wave data to create their individual avatars through Avatar Intelligence powered by Brainiac\u2019s distributed computing.\n\n Complete control of Digital Avatar - Everyone will have his/her own digital avatar in the Metaverse. This avatar can be used to live life and do various tasks in the Metaverse under users authorisation. This is the ultimate use scenario of the Metaverse.\n\n Resurrections - Better algorithms will allow users to create perfect AvI to create value in the Metaverse on their behalf. The ecosystem surrounding AI 2.0 will also further improve.\n\n Genesis - Core functions of Brainiac will be perfected so that the hardware requirement of AvI can be met. At the same time, basic brain electric signals will be stored to set up preliminary avatars.\n\n Reloaded - Users brain wave data can be uploaded through wearable devices to create the foundation of avatars. Users can interact with these avatars.\n\n Revolutions - Connecting to deep brain signals to receive AvI data. Basic interactions among AvIs and the transfer of AvI across different networks will be supported.\n\n Core Tasks of Phase 1 - The Brainiac AI Network makes artificial intelligence accessible to everything!\n\n Blockchain for Metaverse - \n\n Blockchain for Web 3.0 - \n\n Blockchain for NFT - \n\n Blockchain for Industry 4.0 - \n\n Blockchain for Smart City - \n\n Blockchain for Decentralized - \n\n Blockchain for AI Platform - \n\n Blockchain for Transfer - \n\n Blockchain for Finance - \n\n Blockchain for Enterprise - \n\n Why does BRAINIAC exist? - BRAINIAC AI aims to address the issue of slowness in traditional blockchain platforms, security issues, and the impact on the environment.\n\n What is the vision and mission of Brainiac? - Vision: To build a decentralized auto-functioning AI economy. Mission: Stage One: Highly efficient blockchain platform, Stage Two: Decentralized cloud computing platform, Stage Three: Digital asset authentication platform/Digital asset trading platform.\n\n What are main features of BRAINIAC? - Features: SAFER, FASTER, MORE FLEXIBLE.\n\n What are the features of BRAIN coin? - Utilization: BRAIN coins can be used to participate in the network's consensus process, pay for transaction fees, and access advanced AI services. Governance: BRAIN coin holders have the right to participate in the governance of the BRAINIAC AI Network. Staking: BRAIN coin holders can stake their coins to earn rewards by participating in the network's consensus process.\n\n"
