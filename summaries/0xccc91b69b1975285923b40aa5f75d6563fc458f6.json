    "summary": "How much does it cost to launch a reused Falcon 9? Elon Musk explains why reusability is worth it - SpaceX reached a new milestone recently when a Falcon 9 booster launched for the sixth time and then landed safely. How many more times can this booster launch? What\u2019s the theoretical limit? And how much does it actually cost SpaceX to refurbish a Falcon 9 booster between launches and what does this process entail?\n\n Falcon rockets use three configurations of their upper stage. How are they different? - It has long been known that SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rockets use more than one type of upper stage depending on the needs of a given mission, but only now have we learned some more details. Falcon rockets actually use three different upper stages, which differ in how long they can last in orbit.\n\n SpaceX used to conduct static fire tests before every launch, but not anymore. Why is that? - SpaceX used to perform a so-called static fire test before every launch of its Falcon 9 rocket. However, since 2020 SpaceX has in some cases not performed this pre-launch test at all. Let\u2019s take a look at the purpose of a static fire, the types of missions where SpaceX skips this test, and try to figure out why. We will also explain why some static fires are performed with the payload attached and others without.\n\n What have we learned so far about Crew Dragon\u2019s cupola, the largest window to ever fly to space - In less than two weeks, the ground-breaking Inspiration4 mission is scheduled to launch a Crew Dragon spacecraft into orbit with four crew members, none of whom are professional astronauts. Crew Dragon for this mission is equipped with a glass cupola to give the crew the best possible view during their three-day stay in Earth orbit. What have we learned so far about the largest window to ever be flown to space?\n\n"
