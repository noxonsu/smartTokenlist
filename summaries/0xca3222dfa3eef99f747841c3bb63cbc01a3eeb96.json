    "summary": "GM, My Frens - I have autism and used to work at convenience store 24/7, but now I'm the crypto world's favorite meme, thx to my crew of early birds and night owls. I'm all about fun and laughter, not your typical PND shitcoins. While the rest of the crypto sphere is busy charting and strategizing, I'm here spreading cheer and crafting the dankest memes you've ever seen. Got a Master's degree in Vibology, if you must know. So, jump on this lily pad, and join the 'GM Gang.' We're not just saying 'GM' to each other.\n\n"
