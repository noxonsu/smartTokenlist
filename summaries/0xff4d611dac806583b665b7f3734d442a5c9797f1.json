History in the making! Can you imagine how soft those socks were? This led to the alpaca taking the throne as the unofficial Bitcoin mascot. Time to make it official. They even made an amazing song to honor the meme. Give it a listen!\n\n Tokenomics - Don\u2019t ask us too much. We just followed the trend. PACA isn\u2019t a poser though, unless it\u2019s for the camera. He just enjoys relaxing a lot. 100,000,000,000 so we could do the math more easily. 0% taxes. Liquidity locked.\n\n Roadmap - It\u2019s not always about the destination, it\u2019s the journey. But it would be cool to end up somewhere here right?\n\n"
