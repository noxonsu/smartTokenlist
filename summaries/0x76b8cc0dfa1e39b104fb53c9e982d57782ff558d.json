    "summary": "Humans have long thought that they ruled the yard, but dogs are the real kings of the world. - Enough of their petty politics. It's time to make ARF-MERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\n Twice the meta means twice the potential for billion dollar success! Who doesn't love dogs, right? And who doesn't love trump? Well, uhm, maybe a few Democrats and joe biden, but come on, Trump basically said he's gonna support crypto so that makes him the real deal president in our books, yeah? - It may sound like a stroke of genius, but DOG WIF TRUMP is not an original idea. Apparently, there's this whole fandom of dog owners who just can't stop dressing their pets up as donald trump! It's true! Google it and you'll be met with like a gazillian photos of proud dog parents and their little bundles of presidential dynamite!\n\n DOG WIF TRUMP is an Ethereum project that may initially be seen as something that's merely riding on the current trump meta, but it's so much more than that. We'd even dare say that trump is riding on the popularity of dogs, the way we see it! - DOG WIF TRUMP is inspired by the large group of dog owners who show their support (or maybe they just ran out of Halloween costume ideas) for the polarizing political figure by dressing their pets up with golden wigs and lavish suits and ties. Some of these canine cuties are absolutely adorable. Others, TBH, are quite horrifying, but hey, it's the effort that counts, correct? Regardless, interest on this group is huge enough to sustain the hype and gain more eyes for the token.\n\n"
