    "summary": "Note added 4/21/20 by Marc Levoy - Except for links to People > Faculty, this web site has become outdated. Most links to Research projects, Courses in graphics, Technical publications, Slides from talks, Software packages, Data archives, and Cool Demos still function and might be useful. However, links to people other than faculty, infrastructure, and opportunities for students are likely broken or irrelevant.\n\n"
