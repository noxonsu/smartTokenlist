    "summary": "GROK 2.0 - Neurosomatic brainwashing -- the most powerful form of robotization -- consists in temporary activation of the neurosomatic circuit by the brainwasher, together with assurances that only the brainwasher (or the 'god' who 'acts through hum') can turn on this circuit. For full effect, this is, of course, proceeded by normal brainwashing. The victim is first isolated from his or her previous environment and trained to hook the bio-survival circuit onto the 'guru' and/or the Ashram or commune. The emotional circuit is bent and broken by continuous attacks upon status (ego), until the only emotional security left is found in Total Submission to the group reality-island. The re-infantilized victim is then ready to imprint any semantic circuit desired, from psychological cults, political cults, religious cults, etc. The socio-sexual circuit can then easily be programmed for celibacy, for free-love or for whatever sexual game the guru has selected. Then, and only then the neurosomantic buttons are pushed and ecstasy is 'given' to the subject 'by' the guru.\n\n"
