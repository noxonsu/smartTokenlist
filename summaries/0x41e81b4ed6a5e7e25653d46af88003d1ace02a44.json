    "summary": "About $BOJO - We all \"love\" and hate British Trump Boris Johnson. Also known as BoJo or Boris \"Bumblefu\u00a9k\" Johnson, he is Britain's disgraced ex-Prime Minister and resident ~~evil~~ clown. All pandemic restrictions in the world were lifted just because Boris Johnson got drunk. A major Brexit influencer comes into the crypto world to make you rich! Christopher Harbourne aka Chakrit Sakunkrit owns 12% of crypto exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin issuer Tether. He regularly ~~donates~~ invest in Boris Johnson (\u00a31 million) but has fu\u00a9ked up all those investments. Now that Bojo has been tokenized on Ethereum, we are sure that sooner or later Harbourne will buy up the entire $BoJo supply to recoup his investment in the bumblefu\u00a9k and send us to 1b$ MC. Are you in?\n\n"
