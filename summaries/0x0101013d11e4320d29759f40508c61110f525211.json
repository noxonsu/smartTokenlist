    "summary": "BY MATT FURIE - In the early days of the internet, before memes ruled the digital landscape, a talented artist named Matt Furie began his online journey. On March 10th, 2004, he acquired his domain, mattfurie.com, marking the beginning of his creative voyage. Fast forward to April 16th, 2004, and an iconic piece of internet history was captured: the beer frog artwork. Pulled from a snapshot of Matt Furie's website taken on this exact date, this charming frog sat against a tree, leisurely sipping a beer. Little did anyone know that this image would be an early precursor for one of the internet's most iconic memes - Pepe the Frog. The \"Beer Frog\" artwork pictured on Matt Furie's homepage on April 16th 2004\n\n"
