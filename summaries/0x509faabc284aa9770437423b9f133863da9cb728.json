    "summary": "At Holdex, we're helping innovators build the next Web3 products - The internet has fundamentally changed the way we communicate and do business. Running a company from the Caribbean, like from London, became a reality. Web3 is not just a financial movement; it\u2019s an evolution of the internet. While the internet has enabled us to stay in contact globally, unfortunately, it is still challenging to transact due to bureaucracy, corruption, and lack of accessibility to financial services. Bitcoin paved the way for creating digital payments without a centralized authority. What got early pioneers excited about Bitcoin was different from what it was, but rather the potential of the blockchain to become the next inclusive financial ecosystem. Blockchain adoption is still early, and the potential of direct ownership of assets powered by decentralized technologies remains the foundation of this inclusive financial ecosystem. At Holdex, driven by the vision and values of decentralization, we challenge the status quo. We create an impact by building tools to accelerate adoption and help leaders with the same idea succeed. When we partner with Web3 innovators, we commit to solid execution. We amplify their success while working hard behind the scenes. On our journey, we designed and built products that helped more than 100K+ users benefit from inclusive financial products with an accumulation of $1B+ in transaction volume. Our portfolio companies have a total valuation of over $900M.\n\n"
