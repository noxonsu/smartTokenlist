    "summary": "Welcome - Ever since I started this site, as a way to communicate with my friends and tour customers, it had always been my intention to expand the horizons of my birding as well as my photography. On January 1st, 2018 I stopped the operations of Focus On Feathers Guiding, and began a year of exploration. This was to be an exploration of the world, the birds that live there, and an internal, more personal search of myself. One year later, I had traveled all the way around the earth, visited 10 countries, and got to experience not only the birds of these wonderful countries, but the culture, and people of several very different nations. I will now be rebuilding this site, in an effort to allow you to experience the world, the birds and the people, as I have seen them.\n\n"
