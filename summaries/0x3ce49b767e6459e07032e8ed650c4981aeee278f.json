    "summary": "ENABLING AI EVERYWHERE - Bringing human-like intelligence to software & devices\n\n Current AI solutions - Current AI solutions are built for very specialized and narrow applications. These programs are developed in silos and can\u2019t collaborate in teams to solve complex problems, hindering broader adoption of AI solutions.\n\n Machine Learning - Most commercially available AI is focused on Machine Learning, a subfield of AI which is best suited to recognizing patterns but not understanding them. As there is no understanding, Machine Learning can\u2019t explain its thinking so can\u2019t be given autonomy in complex life or death situations. Machine Learning also requires massive amounts of data most people don\u2019t have the resources to gather so for many applications it is not a practical option.\n\n The Tech - A diverse range of collaborative AI applications across the AI spectrum.\n\n The Team - Over 4 decades, we have led more than 1000 person-years of ground breaking real-world AI initiatives\n\n Contact Us - Address: 60 Hazelwood Dr, Champaign, IL 61820, United States\nEmail: info@ainexus.co\n\n"
