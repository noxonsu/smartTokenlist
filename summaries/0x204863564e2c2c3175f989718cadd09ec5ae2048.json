    "summary": "FAQ - 1. What's this?\n\nOnly 2048 tokens and no decimals. A single token cannot be split\ninto parts. so you can only trade a whole amount of tokens (like 1, 5, 80 and\nnot 0.99, 5.5, 80.33).\n\n2. Tokenomics?\n\n2.1. 0% buy and 5% sell tax with 4% going to burn. As there are no\ndecimals, tax cannot be charged if the amount traded is less than 20 tokens.\n2.2. On every 2/4/8/16 sells, if LP balance is greater than 2048/1024/512/256,\n1 token is taken as burn tax no matter the amount being sold.\n2.3. Every 8 hours or 1024 tokens in traded volume, 1 token gets nuked from LP\nif its balance is greater than 256.\n\n3. The narrative?\n\n3.1. Real scarcity. Real burn that affects the token value and\ndistribution.\n\n4. Advices?\n\n4.1. If buying from Uniswap or similar interface, its better to input the\namount of tokens that you want to buy instead of the ETH amount. This way the\nestimations will be more precise on a token with no decimals.\n\n"
