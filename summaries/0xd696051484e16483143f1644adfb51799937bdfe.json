    "summary": "Ben the Beagle's Journey to Adoption by Trump's Son - Ben the beagle came to Animal Care Services in April 2016, covered in severe mange. Before he found his way to New York, Ben spent nearly a month at the Callahan Vet Hospital being treated for his injuries. With any animal being moved out of state, there is a required two-week quarantine. However, due to his injuries Ben remained in San Antonio longer than the required hold. After being medically evaluated, a rescue group picked up Ben from ACS a few days later and took the pup to New York. There, the group -- Rescue Dogs Rock NYC -- were able to connect the beagle to Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump, and his wife, Lara. The couple fostered Ben and decided they wanted to keep him. The Trumps adopted him last August and have been sharing his journey on social media.\n\n"
