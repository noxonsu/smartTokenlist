Same-day appointments. Preventive and chronic care management.\n\n Who We Are - The kind of care you\u2019re used to is not the kind of care you\u2019ll receive at VIPcare. Most physicians see you when you\u2019re sick. In our minds, that\u2019s \u201csick\u201d care, not healthcare. Healthcare is the effort to get you healthy and keep you healthy. That\u2019s the kind of care we provide.\n\n Prevention Mindset - So many health problems could have been prevented had a physician caught them in time. With our comprehensive approach, we strive to get you healthy and keep you healthy, rather than seeing you have recurring health issues.\n\n One on One Time - We believe that the key to preventing illness is one on one time with your doctor. Many physicians see four patients an hour. Not our physicians. Our physicians see eight to ten patients a day, ensuring that they get the time they need to truly treat you. You will never be rushed out our door!\n\n Quality Over Quantity - Not only do we value quality time, but we pride ourselves on creating a quality experience for all of our patients. Creating a VIP atmosphere and giving you the VIP treatment is what gives us our name.\n\n A Health Network - With a network of primary care physicians, specialists, and health coaches, we have created a health network that caters to the Medicare and Medicare Advantage community. We believe that by building a strong network of like-minded health professionals, we will be able to provide top of the line healthcare.\n\n A 5 Star Primary Care Service - We rise above our peers when it comes to quality of care, but what really makes this an exceptional practice is that we cater to those who need it most. We accept patients with both traditional Medicare as well as those with Medicare Advantage plans.\n\n Blog Posts - All Posts.
