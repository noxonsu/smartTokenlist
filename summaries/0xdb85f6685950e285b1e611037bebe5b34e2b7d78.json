    "summary": "Wrapped Zano (WZANO) - Wrapped Zano (WZANO) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that can be exchanged for ZANO on a 1:1 basis at any time. One of the most important considerations of this initiative is transparency. For every WZANO in circulation (i.e. not in the deployment wallet), there will be at least the same amount or more ZANO in the team\u2019s custodial wallet.\n\n"
