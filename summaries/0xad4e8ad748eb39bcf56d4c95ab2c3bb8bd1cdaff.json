    "summary": "Alaskan Klee Kai Breed Information - The Alaskan Klee Kai is a spitz-type breed of dog, developed in the late 20th century as a companion-sized dog resembling the larger Alaskan Malamute and Siberian Husky. They come in four colors: red and white; black and white; gray and white; and all white. The breed was created using the Alaskan Husky, a small amount of Siberian Husky, a slightly larger amount of American Eskimo Dog, and some Schipperkes. The average Alaskan Klee Kai's temperament is curious, agile, aloof, and intelligent. They excel at agility and can withstand high jumps. Albinism may disqualify dogs from show rings and breeding programs.\n\n  - \n\n"
