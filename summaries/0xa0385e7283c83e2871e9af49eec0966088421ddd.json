    "summary": "Ape Initiative - Ape Initiative is the only research center in the world dedicated to the study and conservation of the species most closely related to humans \u2013 the endangered bonobo. Ape Initiative is a federally-recognized non-profit organization - 501(c)(3) - and accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) as an Accredited Related Facility. With a focus on Science, Education, and Outreach, our programs enrich the lives of our bonobos and foster a deeper connection between people and the natural world. Bonobos are an endangered species of African Great Ape with as few as 15,000 - 20,000 individuals in the wild. Understanding bonobo behavior, and how they interact with one another, is critical if we are going to save them. That\u2019s why we developed a scientifically grounded conservation education program for students of all ages. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of scientists and educators by promoting scientific literacy and environmental stewardship.\n\n"
