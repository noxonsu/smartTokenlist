    "summary": "Matt Furie's Pet RAT - \" Well, the main dude is a chilled-out frog. The frog\u2019s little buddy is a rat, but many will mistake him for a mouse. Rats are smarter than mice and domesticated rats are vert sweet creatures. The rat is inspired by my pet rat \u201cWat\u201d. Wat loved to lick me and was very cute. The next creature is a kind of wingless dragon with chicken legs that is ideal for riding. He is friendly yet scary looking and acts like a dog. His master is a bat-like dude that wears jean-shorts. I would describe him as being a cool gamer that likes to hangout in his cave and play video games. The dragon is happy when the frog and rat go and get him out of the cave to go for a ride.\n\n"
