    "summary": "I Guess Guy - I Guess Guy refers to a two-panel image taken from an issue of the webcomic series Gunshow by K.C. Green, originally published in November 2010. The panels show a frowning person looking very disgruntled with their arms crossed in the first panel, followed by them throwing their hands in the air and yelling 'I GUESS' in the second. The panels are most commonly used as a reaction image to express begrudging acceptance of something, with the second panel often being used by itself. It is often used to describe situations that the poster finds to be logically sound (and thus unrefutable) but nonetheless displeasing, pointless, or absurd.\n\n  - \n\n"
