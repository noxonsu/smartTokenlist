    "summary": "High Performance Blockchain for SocialFi - Domi is building the Fastest blockchain in the SocialFi with 100,000 TPS.\n\n PERFORMANCE - The fastest fully decentralized layer one solution ever built\n\n Faster - Cryptographically ordering transactions in synchronization with multiple nodes allows for exceptionally fast, assured transaction speed\n\n Compliance - Regulated by the SEC and fully compliant.\n\n Built for social dapps - Domi will become a socialfi infrastructure capable of supporting a large number of socialfi applications.\n\n How it works - Scalability without reliance on layer 2 solutions. Domi introduces a unique cryptographic hash algorithm that timestamps transactions prior to validation, called Proof of Time (PoT). This enhancement along with the Fast Byzantine Agreement (FBA) in the consensus process allows for exponentially faster block validation time. To further enhance security while maintaining unlimited participation and decentralization, we introduce a new decentralized firewall. This hybrid validation model is composed of core nodes and surveillance nodes. The core nodes are solely responsible for block production and validation. Surveillance nodes are only involved with surveillance of the blockchain and endorsement of transactions.\n\n INSPIRATION - Our objective at Domi is to create the world\u2019s fastest, most secure decentralized network that can be implemented in both public and private sectors.\n\n"
