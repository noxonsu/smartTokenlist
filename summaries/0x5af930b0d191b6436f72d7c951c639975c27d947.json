    "summary": "The Loyal and always dependable - In the annals of history, has there ever been an animal more overlooked than the ever reliable donkey? We think not! It's so easy to neglect how important this creature is in the growth of mankind because it's often stubborn, clumsy and, let's be honest here, quite unsightly. But donkeys have been essential in world development. Donkeys helped the ancient Egyptians ferry the materials needed in building the great pyramids. The industrial revolution was heralded by the tireless work of donkeys. Fuck, even putin achieved his super macho stature by riding a donkey (which was sadly photoshopped to look like a horse). Indeed, donkeys are an integral part of our culture. And Donke - an original character inspired by Matt furie's unique design philosophy - is here to celebrate their vital role in shaping the world as we know it today!\n\n"
