    "summary": "KISHU INU - The Kishu (\u7d00\u5dde\u72ac, Kish\u016b-Ken), sometimes called Kishu Inu or Kishu dog, is a Japanese breed of dog. It is descended from ancient medium-sized breeds and named after the Kishu region, now Mie Prefecture and Wakayama Prefecture. It was designated a living national monument of Japan in 1934. Kishu have been prized since prehistoric times for boar and deer hunting. Like the Shiba, they are often quiet. Kishu will stalk prey quietly rather than bark. They are the most commonly used purebred native Japanese breed used for hunting boar to this day.\n\n"
