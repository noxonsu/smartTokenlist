    "summary": "Scaling Freedom - zkSync Era is a Layer-2 protocol that scales Ethereum with cutting-edge ZK tech. Our mission is not only to merely increase Ethereum's throughput, but to fully preserve its foundational values \u2013 freedom, self-sovereignty, decentralization \u2013 at scale.\n\n Hyperscalability: the Endgame - To meet web3's exponential demand, blockchains needs to scale like the Internet: processing an unlimited number of transactions without a marginal impact on security or cost. We call this property hyperscalability, and this is the ultimate goal of Era's design.\n\n Security++ - ZK-rollups like Era are the only scaling solution that can inherit 100% of Ethereum's security. But theory is not enough. zkSync is committed to go above and beyond to make Era by far the most secure L2, in practice.\n\n A brand new Era for UX - Self-custody combined with intuitive, delightful, and security-fostering UX is critical to onboard the first billion users to web3. Era's design started with the end-user in mind.\n\n Start using zkSync Era by bridging to the network - Use a native bridge or ecosystem partners to transfer tokens from Ethereum and other networks to zkSync Era. Or exchange fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies using Fiat Onramps.\n\n Pushing the frontier, together. - Over 200 projects from Chainlink, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Argent, Gnosis, Curve, and many of the world's largest brands have registered their interest to deploy on zkSync Era. Explore the ecosystem shaping the internet using Ethereum and ZK technology.\n\n"
