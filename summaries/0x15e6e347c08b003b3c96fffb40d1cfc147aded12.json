It allows users and dApps to\nsend messages and assets between Bitcoin and SatoshiVM. Bitcoin serves as the\nsettlement layer, and bridges and rollup scripts are deployed on the Bitcoin\nnetwork.\n\nSEQUENCING LAYER:  This layer consists of an execution node responsible for\nexecuting transactions submitted to the SatoshiVM sequencer and transactions\nsubmitted to the L1 bridge script, generating L2 blocks. It also includes a\nRollup node that handles batched transactions, publishes transaction data and\nblock information to Bitcoin to ensure data availability, and submits validity\nproofs to Bitcoin for finality.\n\nPROVING LAYER: This layer comprises a coordinator, which assigns proof tasks\nto provers and relays the generated proofs to the Rollup node to complete\nfinality verification on Bitcoin. It also includes a prover pool, responsible\nfor generating validity proofs that verify the correctness of L2 transactions. - As depicted in the diagram, the SatoshiVM chain comprises three layers\n\nSETTLEMENT LAYER: This layer provides data availability, ordering, and\nvalidation of proofs for the SatoshiVM chain.
