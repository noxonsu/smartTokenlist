    "summary": "The DecentralizedAI poweredLongevity Network - Rejuve.AI is a decentralized, AI-driven longevity research network allowing people from all over the world to track their health data, receive valuable insights, contribute to cutting-edge longevity research, and earn rewards.\n\n At Rejuve We Care - Rejuve.AI's core mission is to build a decentralized network of researchers, clinics, and data contributors working together to arrive at breakthrough discoveries in the fight against aging, while making the resulting solutions affordable and accessible for all. Rejuve.AI puts power back into the hands of the people, allowing anyone to monetize their health data and yield maximal personal benefit from their contributions.\n\n Our AI - Our probabilistic logic Bayesian net service, BayesianExpert, makes the manual creation of Bayesian networks based on expert rules and statistics directly from the medical literature easy.\n\nOur unsupervised learning compositional neural network allows inferences to be made between different parts of different types of data. This system is able to \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d when certain data is missing by analyzing profiles of other similar profiles.\n\nOur Generative Cooperative Network (GCN) is a deep neural embedding framework which combines multiple neural architectures to create embedding vectors representing aspects of each Rejuve member.\n\n Become A Network Member - Stay up to date with the latest news on what\u2019s happening with Rejuve, the Longevity app, and other exciting events and opportunities.\n\n Our Team - We Care About Your Future\n\n Core Team - Jasmine SmithChief Executive Officer\n\nDr. Deborah DuongChief Technology Officer\n\nDr. Ben GoertzelChief AI Scientist\n\n Our Partners - Help Us Defeat Aging!\n\n Blog - Read More About Us\n\n Genomic Insights Into the Molecular Basis of Longevity - October 17, 2023\n\n The Science of Sound: How Music and Frequency Impact Longevity - October 6, 2023\n\n Rejuve.AI Quarter 3 Recap + Special Announcements on App Redesign + Hard Fork - October 4, 2023\n\n The Evolution of the Generative Cooperative Network: A Leap in Longevity Research - September 25, 2023\n\n Project Powered By SingularityNET Foundation - \n\n"
