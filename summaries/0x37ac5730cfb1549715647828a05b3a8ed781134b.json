    "summary": "Optimize Your Yield: Harness the Power of AI for Maximum Earnings - AIFI has undergone theoretical, testing, and concurrent training for nearly a year. For any AI model, the initial definition and ultimate determination of each set of input data are crucial for training the algorithm. AIFI's machine learning team currently acquires data block by block and coin price data through one-minute feeds during modeling. Protocols often use their native tokens as rewards to boost their APYs. Live test was conducted on Stargate to showcase the competitive advantage gained as AIFI sells native token rewards.\n\n AIFI Tokenomics - Token Name: AiFi Protocol, Ticker: AIFI, Total Supply: 21,000,000, Tax (Buy/Sell): 5%, Tokens for Liquidity / Development: 90% /4%, Tokens for Team / CEX Listing: 3% / 3%\n\n ARTI Development - Pipeline: Implementing and automating the procedure to regularly update the model with real-time data. Model Re-Training: Incremental learning involves training a machine learning model with new data, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model from the beginning. Monitoring: Consistently observe the model's performance and the system's overall health.\n\n"
