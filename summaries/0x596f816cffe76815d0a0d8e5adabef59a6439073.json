    "summary": "Stake, Play & Get Rewards - Meme Kombat is an innovative new gaming platform designed for gaming enthusiasts. From active betting to passive staking, there are rewards for all users.\n\n How staking works - The point of $MK isn't to just buy and trade, but to stake your token in Meme Kombat and bet on battles for the chance to win big! Alongside our regular battles we will also have larger, more hyped battles for people to participate in with large prizes for winners.\n\n Tokenomics - Half of total token supply will be set aside for the $MK presale. The intention is for all who buy presale to participate in Meme Kombat. We have set aside a large percentage of the supply to support that ecosystem and help maintain balance. 10% of the overall supply is reserved for pairing with a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange. $MK is all about participation and community engagement through the love of epic battles. So we have set aside a good amount of tokens for community rewards.\n\n Meme Kombat Roadmap - Presale Launch - Q3 2023: Kickstart the Meme Kombat project through a token presale. Platform Launch - Late Q3 2023: Officially launch the Meme Kombat platform. Season 1 - Immediate Post-Launch: Inaugurate the first season of Meme Kombat. Season 2 - Q4 2023: Launch the second season of Meme Kombat with enhanced features and experiences. Future Development: Continuous Upgrades, Community Engagement, Expansion Plans.\n\n The Meme Kombat Team - Matt Whiteman - Project Lead / Founder, Kai - Frontend Dev, Karem - Blockchain Dev, Adrian - Content & Operations, Stuart - Technologist\n\n"
