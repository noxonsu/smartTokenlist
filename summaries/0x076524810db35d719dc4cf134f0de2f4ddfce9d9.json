If $APEI had its own festival, the funniest face contest would be the main event. Rumor has it that $APEI can translate any meme into Chinese in a second, but always adds a funny emoji. The red ape from $APEI claims its favorite dish is Chinese food, but only in the form of fortune cookies. $APEI recently uncovered the secret of the Chinese dragon, only to find it was just a well-disguised ape with a tail!\n\n"
