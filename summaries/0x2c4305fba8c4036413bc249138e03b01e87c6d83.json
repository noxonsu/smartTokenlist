    "summary": "AN INSPIRING TAIL - DEEGEE isn't really the most lovable dog. He's dirty and smelly and furless. he spent years at the shelter, waiting for someone to adopt him, for someone to love him. But no one did.\n\n OF COURSE, THE TOKEN! - Because what's the purpose of a good narrative without a crypto coin about it, right? And we've got a legit one just for deegee, aptly called $DEEGEE, Pepe's Dog! Deegee sounds like Pepe, yeah? And DEEGEE can also be associated with DOGE! That's two giant coins relevant to Deegee! Genius, right?\n\n THE MEATY GRITTY - 1B TOTAL SUPPLY\n\nNothing fancy, nothing huge, nothing small. just enough tokens for everyone, and just enough tokens to cause a supply shock at the right time.\n\n ZErO TAXES - As in absolutely zilch, nada, kapooch! We don't believe in levying liens on investors and curtailing their trading tactics. hell, you face enough risks in crypto already, right?\n\n LIQUIDITY BURNED - Because we ain't noobs! We know the extreme importance of making you feel safe about your investment, because it's your hard earned money on the table here.\n\n"
