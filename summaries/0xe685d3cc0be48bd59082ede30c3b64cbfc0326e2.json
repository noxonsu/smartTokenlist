    "summary": "A NEW ERA OF INTERCONNECTED BLOCKCHAINS - PIONEERING INTEROPERABILITY 2.O\n\n THE PROBLEM - INTEROPERABILITY 1.0 IS NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRY\n\n SOLUTION - THE FUTURE OF INTEROPERABILITY IS BRIDGELESS\n\n FERRUM\u2019S INFINITY LAYER MAINNET LEVERAGES THE POLKADOT SUBSTRATE INFRASTRUCTURE - Introducing Ferrum\u2019s Infinity Layer mainnet: an interoperable L1 powered by a multichain messaging engine, which leverages the renowned Polkadot Substrate consensus infrastructure.\n\n TECHNOLOGY POWERING INTEROPERABILITY 2.0 - Many unique technologies are combined to create the Infinity Layer mainnet: a multichain execution layer powered by an atomic messaging engine known as Quantum Portal\n\n QUANTUM PORTAL - Quantum Portal core and its related smart contracts with programmable interfaces maintain the state of value and information across blockchains.\n\n VALUE CONSTRAINED MULTI CHAIN ROLLUPS - Value Constrained Multi Chain Rollups taps into the L1 security much like the ZK and Optimistic rollup, but it can support multiple L1s and is not limited to Ethereum. VCPR enables Ferrum\u2019s blockchains to become the L2 for many chains.\n\n MULTICHAIN VALIDATOR STAKING - Multichain Validator Staking allows Ferrum\u2019s blockchains to tap into native security mechanisms of each chain where transactions occur instead of relying on off-chain or secondary chain centralized staking. Staking happens on the chains where validation of transactions/information is required.\n\n LIMITLESS USE CASES FOR DAPPS ON THE INFINITY LAYER MAINNET - Interoperable Metaverses\n\nIn-game assets and avatars can now be traded and exchanged within the same metaverse regardless of which chain that asset originates from.\n\nMultichain Token Staking\n\nStake tokens on chain A and receive rewards on chain B, representing nothing less than a revolution in multichain staking.\n\nMultichain Tokens & Token Deployment\n\nDeploy token smart contracts on the Ferrum Network and have those tokens operate automatically across multiple chains\n\nMultichain NFTs\n\nDeploy NFTs on the Ferrum Network and they will work automatically across multiple chains\n\nMultichain Lending and Borrowing\n\nStake collateral on an established chain with proven security such as Ethereum, and extract a loan on exciting new high-yield earning chains.\n\nMultichains DEXes\n\nMultichain assets coupled with Multichain tokens can balance liquidity across networks and provide limitless use cases for value interoperability.\n\nMultichains Wallets\n\nOne wallet to interact with EVM and Non-EVM compatible networks.\n\nModular DApps\n\ndApps that can utilize pallets, frameworks and components built by the Ferrum team and the open source community. Modularized components serve as the foundational raw material enabling the creation of an unlimited variety of dApps\n\n ROADMAP - 2023\n\nQ1\n\nBeta with Foundry Assets\n\nQ2\n\nTestnet launch POC for public\n\nProduction with Refinery Assets\n\nQ3\n\nQuantum Portal Explorer Alpha\n\nQuantum Portal Miner Nodes\n\nIntegrates with non-EVM with addition of Ionic Assets\n\nQ4\n\nTestnet with validators\n\nQuantum Portal Validator Nodes\n\nAggregated Best Quote Checks across DEXs and networks\n\nView Real-Time Roadmap\n\n"
