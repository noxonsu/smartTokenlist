    "summary": "ETH vs SOLANA - Boink is in fact the original viral meme coined from Team Fortress 2's \"Scout trailer\" in which he baseball-bat-boinks the \"Heavy\" several times for fun. Boink, NOT bonk. Solana was dying and needed bonk in order to sustain itself and therefore created a copycat version of the original meme. Ethereum has long awaited the release of a trusted, potential-infused Boink (the original meme) and has never needed saving until now. We must remind the world that SOL is centralized and cannot be trusted with even the simplest of tasks, such as creating an original meme token. We must remind SOL users that they are second, that they are lesser, that they are inferior to Ethereum Chads & Maxis. Ethereum is the only pure and decentralized blockchain, do not be fooled by cheap tricks. Boink NOT bonk.\n\n BOINK VS BONK - Furthermore, the dog(s) used in all bonk memes are unofficial, AI generated art pieces intended to dupe the original. That is why we will be using Cheems, the dog from the original Boink memes that initially went viral after someone superimposed Team Fortress 2's Scout meme onto Cheemez. SOL cannot be trusted. It always has been and always will be: Boink NOT bonk.\n\n BOINK TOKENOMICS - There is a total supply of 1 million tokens. There will be 1% max wallet limit to avoid big whale dump. NO TAX ON BUY AND SELL. LP will be burned.\n\n Boink Squad - Check out our socials & come join our telegram, be apart of the Boink Squad\n\n"
