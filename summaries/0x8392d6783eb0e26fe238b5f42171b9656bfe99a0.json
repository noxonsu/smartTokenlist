    "summary": "$SHIKEN - The Shikoku-Ken, also known simply as Shikoku, is a rare and ancient Japanese dog breed hailing from the mountainous regions of the Shikoku Island. This medium-sized breed is known for its keen hunting instincts, endurance, and agility, making it a prized companion for hunters in Japan. Shikoku dogs have a well-proportioned and muscular build, a double coat that comes in sesame, black and tan, or red, and a distinctive curled tail. Their alert and loyal nature, combined with a reserved demeanor towards strangers, makes them excellent watchdogs and devoted family pets. Despite their strong-willed and independent spirit, Shikokus are intelligent and trainable, responding best to consistent and positive reinforcement methods.\n\n"
