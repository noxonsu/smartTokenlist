    "summary": "Bad Frog Yarn Co. - Hi, I'm Kristen, founder of Bad Frog Yarn Co. Knitting has been my passion and my solace for nearly 15 years. My mom patiently taught me the basics of knitting when I was struggling and unhappy with the profession I'd chosen and I needed a hobby. I immediately fell in love and over the years I started dreaming of dyeing yarn. When I decided that the professional path I'd been traveling down was bad for my mental health, my family encouraged me to pursue my dreams and so Bad Frog Yarn Co. was born. I want to create yarns that are beautiful and one of a kind. I hope you love them as much as I do.\n\n"
