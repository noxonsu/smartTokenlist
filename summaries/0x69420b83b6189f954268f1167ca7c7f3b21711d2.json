    "summary": "A Boy's Club Special - Ratdog by Matt Furie - Who is Ratdog? Ratdog is the stray dog that lives on the same block as the Boys Clubhouse. But Ratdog isn't your average stray-- he's an outright LEGEND. Known by Pepe and his friends for being a party ANIMAL... he's always sniffing out the next function and getting absolutely wasted at all their parties. Ratdog ALWAYS lives in the moment, his carefree attitude is why the Boys Club characters let him crash on the couch after parties and play video games with them in the morning. I guess you could say that Ratdog the life of the party!\n\n"
