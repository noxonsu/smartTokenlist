    "summary": "The day 2 theme at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee - Once iconic American cities and communities have become hollowed out, dystopian nightmares thanks to Joe Biden and Democrats' 'woke' soft-on-crime and open border policies. In Joe Biden's America, unvetted illegal aliens and deranged criminals are free to roam the streets and terrorize everyday Americans, all while law enforcement is demonized. Cartels have overrun our border, flooding our neighborhoods with enough deadly fentanyl and methamphetamine to kill every American multiple times over. President Donald J. Trump will stand up for our law enforcement and put an end to the senseless crime spree and drug flow that plague America.\n\n"
