    "summary": "Frictionless Yield Generation. Hold and Earn. - RFI works by applying a 1% fee to each transaction and instantly splitting that fee among all holders of the token. Holders do not need to stake or wait for fees to be delivered. Fees are awarded by the smart contract and are immediately reflected in the holders balance. The RFI smart contract is complete at launch. There was no ICO, no pre-sale, and no fundraising of any kind. There are no more features to add. There is no individual or team to be relied upon to give RFI any value. In most DeFi applications, users must stake or park their tokens in a contract to earn a yield. RFI holders can use their tokens in third party lending, yield farming, or any other smart contract in addition to earning yield from the transaction fees. Innovations in the reflect.finance smart contract allow certain addresses, like the Uniswap pool or exchange wallets, to be blocked from earning fees. Because of this, 100% of the fees generated go to holders of the token. The percentage of fees you earn is calculated by the percentage of RFI that you own among holders. This generates a much higher yield than would be possible otherwise.\n\n"
