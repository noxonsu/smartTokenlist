    "summary": "The blockspace ecosystem for boundless innovation - Get your Web3 ideas to market fast with economics that work for you\n\n True interoperability - Polkadot enables cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. Connecting to Polkadot gives you the ability to interoperate with a wide variety of blockchains in the Polkadot network.\n\n Economic & transactional scalability - Polkadot provides unprecedented economic scalability by enabling a common set of validators to secure multiple blockchains. Polkadot provides transactional scalability by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchains.\n\n Easy blockchain innovation - Create a custom blockchain in minutes using the Substrate framework. Connect your chain to Polkadot and get interoperability and security from day one. This ease of development helps Polkadot\u2019s network grow.\n\n High energy efficiency - Polkadot consumes a small fraction of the energy used by conventional blockchains thanks to its next-generation nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) model. Using the equivalent of ~6.6 US households worth of energy per year, Polkadot has the lowest carbon footprint among proof-of-stake protocols analyzed in recent research.\n\n Security for everyone - Polkadot's novel data availability and validity scheme allows chains to interact with each other in a meaningful way. Chains remain independent in their governance, but united in their security.\n\n User-driven governance - Polkadot has a sophisticated governance system where all stakeholders have a voice. Network upgrades are coordinated on-chain and enacted autonomously and without forking the network, ensuring that Polkadot\u2019s development remains future-proof and community-driven.\n\n The DOT token serves three distinct purposes - governance over the network, staking and bonding.\n\n Governance - Polkadot token holders have complete control over the protocol. All privileges, which on other platforms are exclusive to miners will be given to the Relay Chain participants (DOT holders), including managing exceptional events such as protocol upgrades and fixes.\n\n Staking - Token holders keep the network secure and collect rewards by staking DOT. Polkadot\u2019s advanced staking system is designed for maximum decentralization and fair representation, rewarding good actors and punishing bad actors to ensure network security.\n\n Bonding - New parachains are added by bonding tokens. Outdated or non-useful parachains are removed by removing bonded tokens. This is a form of proof of stake.\n\n Polkadot is an open-source project founded by the Web3 Foundation. - Web3 Foundation has commissioned five teams and over 100 developers to build Polkadot, including: ChainSafe, Parity Technologies, Polkadot JS, Soramitsu.\n\n From the blog - Polkadot enjoyed further ecosystem growth in the third quarter of 2023, with impressive metrics around staking, on-chain events and unique accounts.\n\n Fungible Assets on Asset Hub - A technical deep-dive into fungible assets and multilocations on Asset Hub.\n\n How Polkadot's Blockspace Empowers Developers - Discover how Polkadot's blockspace can address blockchain development challenges and empower developers to create, innovate, and thrive.\n\n"
