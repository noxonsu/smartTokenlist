We will provide shelter and care to all healthy and treatable relinquished, abandoned or transferred cats, birds and small mammals until we can bring the adopter and animal together for a lasting relationship.  We also have a low cost clinic on site to provide low cost spay and neuter services, as well as other veterinary care, to rescues, TNR groups and the general community.\n\n"
