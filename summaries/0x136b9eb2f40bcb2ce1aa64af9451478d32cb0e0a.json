    "summary": "Avatar IntelligenceTechnologyNeural DataNew TrendMetaverseWeb 3.0 - Avatar Intelligence aims to realize the scenario imagined by the Brainiac films where human brain is uploaded to the Internet, or where a program identical to a user's brain is created on the Internet.\n\n Distribution of Neural Data on Brainiac Blockchain - Brainiac will build a general-purpose platform around Avatar Intelligence. Any user can use the tools on Brainiac to upload and store their brain wave data to create their individual avatars through Avatar Intelligence powered by Brainiac\u2019s distributed computing.\n\n Resurrections - Better algorithms will allow users to create perfect AvI to create value in the Metaverse on their behalf. The ecosystem surrounding AI 2.0 will also further improve.\n\n Genesis - Core functions of Brainiac will be perfected so that the hardware requirement of AvI can be met. At the same time, basic brain electric signals will be stored to set up preliminary avatars.\n\n Reloaded - Users brain wave data can be uploaded through wearable devices to create the foundation of avatars. Users can interact with these avatars.\n\n Revolutions - Connecting to deep brain signals to receive AvI data. Basic interactions among AvIs and the transfer of AvI across different networks will be supported.\n\n Core Tasks of Phase 1 - The Brainiac AI Network makes artificial intelligence accessible to everything!\n\n Blockchain for MetaverseWeb 3.0NFTIndustry 4.0Smart CityDecentralizedAI PlatformTransferFinanceEnterprise - Blockchain for Metaverse, Blockchain for Web 3.0, Blockchain for NFT, Blockchain for Industry 4.0, Blockchain for Smart City, Blockchain for Decentralized, Blockchain for AI Platform, Blockchain for Transfer, Blockchain for Finance, Blockchain for Enterprise\n\n The Brainiac blockchain platform - The Brainiac blockchain platform is the first AI-optimised blockchain platform. Low transaction speeds, lack of security, the complexity of usage, and squandered resources are four key concerns in blockchain that we address with AI technology. We built a public blockchain platform that is both functional and dependable.\n\n AI Service Platform - It aims to serve as a smart, secure, fair and trustworthy marketplace for developers and clients alike.\n\n Auto-ML Platform - It enables people with no background in AI to perform ML on a BRAINIAC node to get the AI models they need.\n\n Assisted NFT Trading - It aims to serve as a smart, secure, fair and trustworthy marketplace for developers and clients alike.\n\n Industry 4.0 Platform - AI, Big Data, IoT and blockchain technologies, it will be a powerful tool for implementing Industry 4.0.\n\n M-Port - An AI-Powered DID Platform based on Biometric Information\n\n Why does BRAINIAC exist? - The development of blockchain is held back by three obstacles: Slowness, Security Issues, Impact on environment\n\n What is the vision and mission of Brainiac? - Vision: To build a decentralized auto-functioning AI economy. Mission: Stage One: Highly efficient blockchain platform, Stage Two: Decentralized cloud computing platform, Stage Three: Digital asset authentication platform/Digital asset trading platform\n\n What are main features of BRAINIAC? - SAFER, FASTER, MORE FLEXIBLE\n\n What are the features of BRAIN coin? - Utilization, Governance, Staking\n\n"
