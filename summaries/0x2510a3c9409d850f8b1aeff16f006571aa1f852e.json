    "summary": "Pest Free Token - A project to contribute to predator free 2050 by deploying traps, funding pest eradication initiatives, and raising community awareness.\n\n Option 1: PFT pest traps - Backyard trapping is the easiest way for New Zealand to become pest free by 2050. You can order a PFT trap for your backyard for only $20 plus shipping. If you catch something in your PFT trap, we will reward you with free PFT tokens.\n\n Option 2: PFT crypto tokens - The PFT token is New Zealand's first use of cryptocurrency solely for charity. Buy buying the token you generate funds for our native birds. Your tokens are yours to keep. You can sell them (hopefully for profit) whenever you like.\n\n Project area & impact - We ship traps anywhere in the country. This makes the Pest Free Token project a national solution to a national problem. Help us reach our goal of getting a PFT trap in every suburb.\n\n Our four values - Our four values drive everything we do. They ensure that the project creates a meaningful impact to both the predator free industry and the wider conservation sector.\n\n"
