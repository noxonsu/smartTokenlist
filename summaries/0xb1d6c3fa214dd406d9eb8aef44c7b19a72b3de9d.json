    "summary": "Tokenize the World - Infrastructure for digital asset tokenization\n\n The Premiere Asset Tokenization Protocol - Holograph\u2019s mission is to bring all the world\u2019s assets onchain. Holograph achieves this with holographic assets, which are fungible and non-fungible tokens that exist natively on any public or private blockchain.\n\n Credibly Neutral - Holographic assets are not locked in to any specific blockchain ecosystem, allowing issuers to control where and how they are deployed.\n\n Natively Composable - Holograph allows assets to move between blockchains while maintaining the same contract address, enabling issuers to easily track and verify ownership.\n\n Minimize Bridge Risk - Holograph's modular design minimizes cross-chain risk by enabling issuers to select from multiple message passing protocols.\n\n Supports All Types of Digital Assets - Holograph can be used to represent any variety of digital asset. Holograph allows issuers the flexibility to customize asset functionality to meet the needs of their customers.\n\n A Complete Solution for Asset Issuers - Holograph provides customizable infrastructure that allows for the management of asset creation, deployment, and security.\n\n"
