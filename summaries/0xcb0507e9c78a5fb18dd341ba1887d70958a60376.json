    "summary": "What is EROS? - EROS is an Ethereum protocol that allows the creation of peer-to-peer parimutuel markets that anyone can join. This building block is the foundation of novel on-chain initiatives, from a platform for AMM-based positional markets to immersive gamified experiences, and much more.\n\n How does it work? - The set of smart contracts composing EROS leverages uncensorable sUSD as collateral, an immutable source of truth for market settlement from Chainlink data feeds, and all the advantages (speed, costs, and security) of a rollup-centric network like Ethereum.\n\n"
