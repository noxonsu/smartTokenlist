Blockchain is the underlying technology, functioning as a \u2018ledger\u2019 or record of transactions made. Hundreds of currencies are in circulation, such as Bitcoin, Ether, Monero, etc. Each is designed by one or more brilliant individuals, usually meant to run as a decentralised system so that no single entity can control it. Cryptocurrency units are usually generated on the basis of an algorithm announced to everyone in advance, by \u2018miners\u2019 using powerful computers. Having expended a lot of time and electricity on \u2018mining\u2019, these miners can hold on to the units or sell to others.\n\n How to start trading in cryptocurrencies? - Fundamentally, a seller sells their currency to gain cash and a buyer buys expecting to hold the currency until its value increases in dollar/rupee terms. In mid-August 2021, the total market value of all cryptocurrency exceeded $2 trillion, with Bitcoin alone making up 44% of that. As the graph above shows, a currency can start small and reach very high \u2013 but with a number of bumps along the way. People with a lot of faith in the future of cryptocurrencies subscribe to a \u2018HODL\u2019 mindset, meaning \u2018hold on for dear life\u2019 to the roller-coaster they expect to ride.\n\n What is the purpose of cryptocurrency? - As indicated by \u2018currency\u2019, they were originally intended to be used in the same way as rupees and dollars are, as a medium of payment between people for products and services purchased.\n\n What is the affiliate Program? - Affiliate Program is an opportunity for our members to earn some extra income by inviting other people to open an investment account with us.\n\n"
