    "summary": "Who is Archie? - Bob Montana, the original cartoonist of the 'Archie' comics, made a significant impact on American pop culture. Drawing inspiration from his hometown and his classmates from Haverhill High in the 1930s, Montana crafted the beloved world of Archie. The first issue of the Archie comic book debuted in November 1942, and by 1946, Montana was creating daily and Sunday strips for 700 newspapers. Tragically, his career was cut short when he died of a heart attack on January 4, 1975, while cross-country skiing in Meredith. After his passing, Dan DeCarlo took over the strip.\n\n"
