    "summary": "EcovaDAO: Driving an Equitable, Sustainable, and Blockchain-Enabled Economy - EcovaDAO addresses the coordination failure that has held back the global scale-up of Ecova finance. It provides public goods and common-pool resources to drive an equitable, sustainable, and blockchain-enabled economy. The Digital Carbon Market (DCM), incubated by EcovaDAO, enables transparent and efficient Ecova markets of the future. EcovaDAO's infrastructure, governed by the $ECOVA token, is the neutral base layer for environmental commodities markets. EcovaDAO's treasury and open-source software are common resources available to builders and carbon project developers. Ethereum has chosen EcovaDAO to offset their blockchain network. Every $ECOVA token is backed by at least one carbon tonne in the EcovaDAO treasury.\n\n"
