They anticipated an ordinary night of fun, but what ensued was an extraordinary adventure. Following a toast to Sonic's birthday, the party woke up the next morning in a luxury suite with no memory of the previous night. The suite was trashed, the puppy Inu was missing, there was a tiger in the bathroom, and Harry's wand was nowhere to be found. As if things couldn't get weirder, they discovered a baby in the closet and a mysterious chicken roaming the suite. Ever since that nightmare he became a cop and on his free time is working on a time machine so he can go back in time and put their blood on the ethereum blockchain, become blood brothers, and make hpso10inu a reality.\n\n"
