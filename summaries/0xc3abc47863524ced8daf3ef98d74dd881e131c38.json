    "summary": "Lumi Finance - Unlock LUA token's potential through a balanced risk approach, adaptable yields, and a secured rising floor price for unbounded financial expansion\n\n AMM with dynamic & sustainable yield - Lumi Finance's virtual AMM system dynamically mints and burns LUA tokens based on demand, as users buy and sell tokens through the protocol. The purchase of LUA tokens is made using different stablecoins, which are subsequently held in the protocol's reserve to uphold both the floor value and market price.\n\n Dynamic MFR Algorithm with balanced risk - The LUA token's value fluctuates, yet it has a minimum guaranteed value ensured by its native stablecoin reserves. LUA traders are aware of their maximum potential losses. However, if LUA demand grows, this floor price increases based on MFR Algorithm, securing constant profits.\n\n Staking Reward and LUA Option - Staking removes LUA from circulation, increasing its scarcity and, consequently, its market value. Incentives are provided in the form of a unique financial token called LUA Option, which functions like an option with a dynamic strike price.\n\n"
