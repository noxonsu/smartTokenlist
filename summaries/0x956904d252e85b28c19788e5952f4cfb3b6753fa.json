    "summary": "The Origin - Ken was a beloved mixed-breed dog who joined our family in the fall of 1996 as a one-month-old puppy. Growing up alongside two older brothers and surrounded by neighborhood friends, Ken quickly became a cherished member of our lively household. He was known for his playful and mischievous nature, and he was an adventurous spirit who loved car rides and outdoor trips, especially the annual 10-day summer camps in Hokkaido. Ken left lasting paw prints across the island and in our hearts. He was with us for ten wonderful years, and his memory continues to bring warmth and joy to our lives.\n\n  - \n\n"
