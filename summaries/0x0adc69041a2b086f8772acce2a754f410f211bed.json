    "summary": "Aave Document Hub - Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.\n\n Aavenomics - The Aavenomics introduce a formalized path to the decentralization and autonomy of the Aave Protocol.\n\n Governance Forum - This forum is dedicated to Aave\u2019s governance discussion for matters such as Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs), risk factors, and general governance discussions.\n\n Risk Framework - The Risk Framework analyses the fundamental risks of the protocol and describes the processes in place to mitigate them.\n\n Asset Risk - Asset Risk goes over the implications of adding a new asset. Aave's methodology quantifies the risks of each asset assessing its fit as well as the appropriate risk parameters.\n\n Liquidity Risk - Liquidity Risk presents the liquidity risk mitigation strategies in place validating them by an analysis of the historical utilization of the protocol and the liquidity of aTokens.\n\n Interest Rate Model - Aave's borrow interest rate model is central in the management of liquidity risk. As utilization rises, so do the borrow rates as a consequence of the higher price of capital. The Interest Rate Model is described with the parameters of each currencies.\n\n Aave's Market Risk Assessment by Gauntlet - Gauntlet Network uses Agent Based Simulation to stress Aave V1, V2 and the Safety Module under stressed market conditions both in terms of price and market congestion. The simulations shows the Protocol is able to face extreme market conditions while maintaining solvency.\n\n Developers - A deep dive into Aave's smart contracts to understand how the protocol works under the hood.\n\n"
