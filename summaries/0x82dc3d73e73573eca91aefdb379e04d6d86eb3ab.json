    "summary": "THE CUTEST DOG ON ETH - Once upon a time, in a quaint village, there lived an \u200badorable brown-furred dog named MINKY. His twinkling eyes \u200band playful nature made him the village favorite. MINKY \u200blived with Mrs. Peabody, an elderly woman in a cozy \u200bcottage. Every day, Minky would explore the village, playing with \u200bchildren and spreading joy. One sunny afternoon, he found \u200ba tiny kitten stuck in a thorny bush. Carefully, MINKY freed \u200bthe kitten and brought her home. Mrs. Peabody named the \u200bkitten Pippin, and the two became best friends. One stormy night, MINKY noticed the library door was \u200bopen, and rain was soaking the books. He barked \u200bloudly, alerting the villagers who quickly saved the \u200bbooks. To honor Minky\u2019s bravery, the village held a \u200bspecial celebration with games, treats, and a parade. \u200bMINKY, riding on a decorated float with Pippin, was \u200bthe guest of honor. From that day on, MINKY was not just the adorable \u200bbrown-furred dog but also the village hero. He \u200bcontinued to spread joy and love, reminding everyone \u200bthat even the smallest among us can make a big \u200bdifference. And so, MINKY lived happily ever after, \u200bcherished by all.\n\n"
