    "summary": "KERMIT - Kermit the Frog is a frog puppet created by American puppeteer Jim Henson, most notable for his appearances on the television shows The Muppets and Sesame Street. Kermit has become an icon of popular culture, and he is a prominent subject of multiple internet memes, including Kermit Drinking Tea, Evil Kermit, Kermit Falling Down a Stairwell and many others. Kermit the Frog's earliest incarnation aired on the television show Sam and Friends, which aired in 1955. The puppet wasn't supposed to be a frog, but eventually became one during the 1960s. In the 1970s, he appeared on Sesame Street, often in the role of a news reporter, and later on The Muppet Show as the host of the program. Since then, Kermit has appeared most notably in various movies, including Muppet Treasure Island in 1996 and The Muppets in the 2011.\n\n"
