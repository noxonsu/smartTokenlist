    "summary": "Dogewifscarf - After a breeder went out of business, she was brought to an animal protection center along with 19 other Shiba Inu dogs. While many of her companions were euthanized, she was lucky enough to be rescued by the volunteer group Chibawan and put up for adoption. She joined our family in November 2008. Her birthday is November 2nd. She is a kind and laid-back person. She will be promoted to an angel on May 24th, 2024, at the age of 18 and a half.\n\n"
