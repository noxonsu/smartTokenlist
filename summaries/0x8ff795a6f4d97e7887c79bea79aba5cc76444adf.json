    "summary": "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash - Bitcoin Cash brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as 'Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash'. Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralized development.\n\n Why Use Bitcoin Cash? - With Bitcoin Cash, you can send money to anyone, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Like the Internet itself, the network is always on. No transaction is too big or too small. And you never need anyone\u2019s permission or approval.\n\n Benefits for Merchants - The network fee for a typical Bitcoin Cash transaction is less than one penny. If you want to convert your BCH into fiat currency, such as US dollars, you can do that through merchant processors for a cost that is still much lower than credit card processing.\n\n The History of Bitcoin Cash - In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the famous whitepaper entitled 'Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System'. In 2009, he released the first bitcoin software that powered the network, and it operated smoothly for several years with low fees, and fast, reliable transactions.\n\n Decentralized Development - With multiple independent teams of developers providing software implementations, the future is secure. Bitcoin Cash is resistant to political and social attacks on protocol development. No single group or project can control it. Multiple implementations also provides redundancy to ensure that the network retains 100% uptime.\n\n"
