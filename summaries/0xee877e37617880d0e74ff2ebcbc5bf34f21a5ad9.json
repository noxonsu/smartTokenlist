    "summary": "Grandpa Pepe - Grandpa Pepe is the endearing and sage-like \u200belder of the Pepe the Frog meme family. Originating from the popular \u201cBoys Club\u201d comic series by Matt Furie, Grandpa Pepe represents a wiser, older, and often more humorous take on the beloved character. With his gray hair, glasses, and gentle smile, he embodies the nostalgic and comforting presence of a grandparent who has seen it all and has the wisdom to share.\n\n  - \n\n"
