    "summary": "SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG - Shadow Wizard Money Gang, continued We Love Casting Spells, is one of Dj Smokey's producer tags, used in the Joeyy song \"Gout,\" released in early December 2022. The producer tag, which is similar to the \"legalize nuclear bombs\" tag also popularized by Joeyy, went viral on TikTok in January 2023 when it was paired with a clip of a TikToker saying \"masturbation is a form of witchcraft.\" In May 2023, the meme spawned a fan art trend on Twitter akin to Wizardposting. The tag actually belongs to Canadian producer Louka Tessier, who allows Smokey to use them\n\n"
