With Firmseed, everyone can invest in a variety of properties, including residential and commercial buildings. It\u2019s much better than buying property yourself because it\u2019s all done online and the experience is simple, transparent and hassle free.\n\n How does Firmseed work? - Firmseed uses blockchain to facilitate the fractional ownership of real estate assets. Our platform allows multiple individuals to pool their resources together to purchase a property, with each individual owning a fraction of the asset. Investors can then earn rental income and potentially benefit from any capital appreciation of the property.\n\n What are the advantages of investing with Firmseed? - Investing with Firmseed offers several advantages, including: Diversification, Liquidity, Transparency, and Access.\n\n How do I invest with Firmseed? - To invest with Firmseed, you first need to sign up for an account on the app. Once you\u2019ve created an account, you can browse the properties available for investment and select the ones you\u2019re interested in. You can then invest in these properties using cryptocurrencies or fiat.\n\n What kind of due diligence does Firmseed conduct on properties? - Our team conducts thorough due diligence on each property before it is listed on our platform. This includes an assessment of the property\u2019s location, quality, potential returns, and any legal or regulatory requirements. We also work with experienced property managers to ensure that the property is well-maintained and generating rental income.\n\n What are the fees associated with investing with Firmseed? - Firmseed charges a management fee for each property, which covers the costs associated with managing and maintaining the property. This fee is typically a percentage of the rental income earned from the property.\n\n How is my investment secured on Firmseed? - Investments made on Firmseed are secured using blockchain, which ensures that all transactions are secure and transparent. Additionally, our team conducts thorough due diligence on each property to ensure that it meets our strict criteria for quality and potential returns.\n\n What is the minimum investment amount on Firmseed? - The minimum investment amount on Firmseed varies depending on the property. However, we aim to make our investments accessible to a wide range of investors, so the minimum investment amount is typically as low as $10.\n\n What kind of returns can I expect from investing with Firmseed? - Returns on investments made through Firmseed will depend on several factors, including the type of property, its location, and the prevailing market conditions. However, our team carefully selects each property to ensure that it has the potential to generate strong returns.\n\n What am I investing in? - When you invest in a property on Firmseed, you are investing in the shares of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that will own the title deed to the subject property. All investors in a property will be issued shares in the SPV in proportion to the amount they invested.\n\n Can I visit the property I invested in? - No. As part of our commitment to being fully transparent with our investor base, all properties offered on the Firmseed will include a full 3D walkthrough, high resolution photos and inspection reports. However as we generally look to offer properties that are already tenanted, visiting those units can be difficult and impractical, especially with many investors in each property. It is therefore not operationally feasible to arrange visits to all properties.\n\n What are Firmseed's services? - Firmseed is in charge of operating the platform as well as identifying and managing investments on behalf of investors until the end of their Investment Term (i.e. until a property has been sold and capital returned back to investors). This includes ensuring that all digital and other operations are running smoothly and in compliance with regulations, that assets are being identified and evaluated appropriately, and that investments are being executed and managed responsibly. In addition to financial administration, we eliminate all operational headaches for our investors as they do not have to worry about tenant operations, leasing, maintenance or any technical requirements.\n\n How do I view detailed information regarding investments on Firmseed? - It\u2019s simple and free. You can register on the app and create an account within a couple of minutes. After you have registered, you can go through all available investment opportunities and get full access to the details on each, including but not limited to the property\u2019s floor plan, a Firmseed investment memorandum, a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) produced by a trusted third party data provider, Financial Projections and walk-through images of the properties.\n\n"
