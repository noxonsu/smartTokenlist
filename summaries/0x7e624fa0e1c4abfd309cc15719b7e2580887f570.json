Join the quest now!\n\n How to Participate in a Polkastarter IDO? - A good place to start is: what is Polkastarter? (We\u2019ll give you the brief version). Polkastarter is a platform that connects young projects with early community members through initial decentralized offerings or IDOs. During an IDO, a project will distribute tokens to community members (aka IDO participants) in exchange for funding. Thus, projects get to raise capital and grow the community, and participants get in (very) early to high-upside potential tokens. A happy marriage!\n\n What is an IDO (Initial Decentralized Offering)? - \n\n Funded Projects - \n\n Cryptoverse - 9911 NFTs\n\n Galaxy Fight Club - $GCOIN\n\n Highstreet - $HIGH\n\n Thetan Arena - $THG\n\n Orion Money - $ORION\n\n Wilder World - $WILD\n\n"
