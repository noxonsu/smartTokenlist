    "summary": "Bridge your Bitcoin and start earning. - Deposit and redeem BTC in DeFi without intermediaries using Threshold's tBTC.\n\n tBTC is Threshold\u2019s decentralized bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. - \n\n Stakers escrow T tokens to run a node on the Threshold Network and earn rewards. - \n\n Liquidity providers earn yields by depositing assets into liquidity pools. - \n\n Make the most of your T tokens on the Threshold Network by participating in DAO governance. - \n\n Threshold leverages threshold cryptography to protect digital assets by distributing operations across independent parties, requiring some threshold number of them (t-of-n) to cooperate. - \n\n The Threshold DAO is a decentralized community of T token holders and their delegates who collectively vote to decide what's next for the network. - \n\n TIP-060 Solana Growth Partnership - tBTC has successfully launched on Solana, but with limited usage and in competition with existing efforts to bring native wBTC to Solana. There exists an opportunity now for a first mover advantage to establish tBTC as the new canonical BTC on Solana. To do that, the cold start problem for tBTC TVL and volume on Solana needs to be addressed immediately with new protocol integrations that increase the liquidity & utility of tBTC as collateral. This is a proposal for the Threshold DAO to engage in a partnership with Mango & Dual DAO to deliver products supported by CKS Systems liquidity to bootstrap TVL for tBTC across the Solana DeFi ecosystem.\n\n TIP-53: Mint 470M Threshold work tokens for DAO to distribute per the stable yield model - \n\n"
