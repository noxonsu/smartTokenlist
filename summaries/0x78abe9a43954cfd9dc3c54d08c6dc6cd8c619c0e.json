    "summary": "what\u2019s up! Name\u2019s $CRUSH, I'm Luckiest Lobster! - Just last week, I was chillin' in a shipment, headed for what I thought was my last gig at a Red Lobster in Pueblo, Colorado. But fate had other plans, my dudes! A cool dishwasher spots me. Next thing I know, they\u2019re calling me Crush, after that legendary Orange Crush defense from the Denver Broncos. They even decked out my quarantine tank with Broncos helmets, that is totally my fav. I\u2019m just living my best life, turning what could've been my dinner plate fate into a full-on Denver feature. Missed $WIF? Missed $BOME? Allow me to introduce this Rare Orange Lobster, the only lucky winner of the Bull Run! Tokenomics Total supply: 1B Tax: 0/0 Sure, $CRUSH is not gonna make you rich or anything, just gonna level up your luck game, that's all.\n\n"
