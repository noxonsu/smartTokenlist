Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:\n\n> Hi there! I\u2019m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is\n> my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like\n> pi\u00f1a coladas. (And gettin\u2019 caught in the rain.)\n\n\u2026or something like this:\n\n> The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing\n> quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ\n> employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the\n> Gotham community.\n\n"
