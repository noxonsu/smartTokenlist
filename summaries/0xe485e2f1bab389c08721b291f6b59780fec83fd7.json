    "summary": "Preventing front running and malicious MEV on Ethereum - Shutter is an open-source project that aims to prevent front running on Ethereum by using a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol.\n\n fair markets censorship resistance no protocol change - Shutter is a project to address the challenge of malicious MEV on Ethereum as well as other information asymmetries in distributed systems. Shutter aims to protect users from such exploitation by employing a distributed key generation mechanism, ensuring fair and secure transactions on Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions like rollups and sidechains.\n\n What Is MEV? - Maximal Extractable Value or MEV is the revenue the block producer (e.g. validator, miner, sequencer) can extract via front running, injecting, reordering or censoring transactions. The MEV extracted in 2020 alone was worth more than $314M \u2014 and that is only a lower bound.\n\n How Shutter works - Shutter uses a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol. The mechanism used by Shutter can be implemented into various layers. The first instantiation we built is a simple drop-in solution for smart contracts at the application level, which is gas efficient and doesn\u2019t require L1/L2 protocol changes.\n\n Shutter DAO - A DAO has always been at the core of the vision of Shutter's value proposition. It is an integral part of how the system is designed to function, especially concerning the Keyper Set Selection Process and the Set Management.\n\n Introducing the Shutter Network Genesis Allocations - Phase 1 of a Shutter DAO focuses on laying a solid groundwork and establishing effective governance. During this initial phase, a comprehensive governance framework is created, ensuring a fair distribution of the initial token allocation and introducing non-transferable tokens.\n\n"
