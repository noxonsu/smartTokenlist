    "summary": "DRIP Network - DRIP Network is the latest project developed by Forex_Shark, BB and team. The official token of the DRIP Network is DRIP (BEP-20) on the Binance Smart blockchain (BSC) that captures value by being scarce, deflationary, censorship resistant, and by being built on a robust, truly decentralized blockchain. The recommended exchange for trading DRIP is the Fountain contract which can be found directly on the platforms website under the 'swap' tab, as it allows us to waive the initial 10% tax on buys and provides the lowest prices and highest liquidity, resulting in less slippage for larger trades.\n\n"
