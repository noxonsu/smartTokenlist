    "summary": "Story about $KITTY - Before making waves in the financial sector with the monikers Roaring Kitty (or DeepFuckingValue on Reddit), Gill harbored dreams of track stardom, even gracing the pages of Sports Illustrated, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Gill's initial foray into YouTube content came with a video of him running a mile in 4 minutes and 33 seconds, falling short of a bet to break the 4-minute-30-second mark. While his aspirations of becoming a racing star fizzled out due to injury, Gill redirected his focus towards the stock market. In 2019, he assumed the role of Director of Financial Wellness at the life insurance firm MassMutual. That same year, he joined Reddit and commenced posting on the WallStreetBets subreddit. Gill shot to widespread fame through his involvement in the GameStop short squeeze on January 27, 2021. Under his Reddit handle \"DeepFuckingValue,\" he garnered attention for investing in GameStop (GME) stocks, vehemently championing GME across social media platforms and his YouTube channel, Roaring Kitty.
