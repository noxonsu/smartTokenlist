    "summary": "Trump Hold Dog, Dog Rockets to Moon! - Trump, with his loyal dog by his side, ready to take on Joe Biden in the race for the White House.\n\n TrumpWifDog is an Ethereum project that might seem like it's hopping on the Trump meme train, but it\u2019s way more than that. We'd even dare say that Trump is riding on the popularity of dogs, the way we see it! TrumpWifDog is inspired by the legion of dog lovers who show their support for Trump by dressing their pets up in red MAGA hats and golden wigs. Some of these four-legged patriots are absolutely adorable. Others, to be honest, look like they just came out of a canine costume nightmare, but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts, right? Regardless, the interest in this group is huge enough to sustain the hype and gain more eyes for the token. With Trump holding his dog high, exclaiming, \"Wow, what a beautiful dog!\" we\u2019re not just aiming for the moon; we\u2019re aiming to unite dog lovers everywhere. So join us, laugh with us, and let\u2019s make America great again! - \n\n"
