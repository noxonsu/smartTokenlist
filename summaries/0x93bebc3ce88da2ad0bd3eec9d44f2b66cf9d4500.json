    "summary": "Launch App - DeFarming Protocol or Deflation Farming Protocol - A protocol that allows users to profit through farming in a deflationary mechanism (debase), specifically the protocol can also switch to Volatility Farming when rebase mechanism completed\n\n Protocol - The DeFarming protocol is built on a smart Debase mechanism, meaning the total supply will be reduced by 0.07% every 1-hour epoch, equivalent to a total supply reduced by 1.67% per day\n\n Protect and Farming - Protect Pool is an innovative solution designed to empower users to protect their token, ensuring that their token holdings remain protected from depletion caused by debase mechanism\n\n Staking - The DeFarming protocol specifically incentivizes liquidity providers by sharing 80% of the revenue collected from a 3% buy/sell tax\n\n Volatility Farming - This represents an intelligent idea implemented by the project, seamlessly integrating the Volatility Farming on Debase Mechanism to Deflation Farming Protocol. It provides users with an effective means to mitigate the risk of token debase while simultaneously offering lucrative incentives for those participating in the protection process\n\n Mission - Introducing a paradigm shift towards innovation, sustainability, and user-centric empowerment. Our mission encompasses a set of core values that guide us in creating a financial ecosystem that not only preserves and grows assets but also contributes to broader global initiatives\n\n Trading Fee & Treasury - The Treasury of the Deflation Farming Protocol plays a pivotal role in sustaining the project's growth and ensuring the effective distribution of resources. It is generated from a combination of buy and sell fees, specifically 3% of the buy fee and 3% of the sell fee within the project. Allocate 80% to LP staking and 20% to marketing\n\n"
