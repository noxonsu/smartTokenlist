    "summary": "AMOGUS - Amogus is no ordinary crewmate. Hailing from a village shrouded in sus, Amogus became a beacon of wisdom and power. So mighty and cunning, Amogus managed to defeat the dreaded Ultimate Sus, transforming it into a suspicious Sus and liberating us from the eternal sus pain. Now, we proudly stand as suspension Sus, forever grateful to our Lord and savior, Amogus. Standing at 1.21 meters tall, this iconic figure roams biomes from hell to heaven, spreading the sus gospel far and wide. Whether it\u2019s in the fiery depths of lava cauldrons or the ethereal expanse of sus town, Amogus is everywhere, ready to sus things up!\n\n"
