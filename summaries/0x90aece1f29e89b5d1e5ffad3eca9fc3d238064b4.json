God redeemed your elder and is still sanctifying him.\n\n Poor Richard\u2019s Christianity - Mere cultural Christianity will not protect the society a famous atheist says he values.\n\n What Temptation Is and Is Not - Until we see Jesus, we will continue to suffer temptation.\n\n Finding Peace beyond the Illusion of Control - Our salvation involves so much more than what we are currently experiencing, and even creation groans, waiting for the sons of God to be revealed.\n\n Everything about God Matters - Divine simplicity.\n\n Undistracted by Moralism - While moralism sets the bar to an achievable height, Jesus sets the standard farther than we can reach.\n\n Christ\u2019s Spotless Bride: New Testament Images of the Church (Part Two) - Even when Christians fail and through sin bring harm to other members of Christ\u2019s church, the Savior\u2019s love and mercy is greater still.\n\n The Gateway Drug To Post-Christian Paganism - The secret to political integrity and discernment for Christians is a high view of God, his Word and his gospel.\n\n The Beauty of Divine Simplicity - The doctrine\u2019s confessional value.\n\n"
