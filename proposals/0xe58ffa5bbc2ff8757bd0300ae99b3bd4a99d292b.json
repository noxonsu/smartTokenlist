    "proposal": "Hello $TAIWANese community! Congrats on reaching 52 holders in the ETH network, that's a solid start! Ever thought of deploying your own DEX or running a blockchain-based lottery? You can even create a multicurrency crypto wallet or set up ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming. It's not playing, it's creating. See my profile for demo and details."
