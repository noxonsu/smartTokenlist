    "proposal": "Diving into the ETH blockchain with PEP, the unique cousin of Pepe ready to outshine dogs, cats, and all meme coins with pure decentralization and no taxes. \ud83d\udc38 With 201 holders in the ETH network, it's clear you're spreading those vibes far and wide. Why not amplify that reach? Our tools can help your community deploy their own DEX or even run a lottery, sharing revenue while staying true to the PEP ethos. Let's make decentralization not just a principle but a practice."
