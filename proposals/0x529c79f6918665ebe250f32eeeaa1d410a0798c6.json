    "proposal": "Hello HyperGPT community! Congrats on reaching 7049 holders - that's quite a feat! It seems you're already harnessing the power of AI. How about adding some B2B tools to the mix? Imagine integrating a DEX or a Blockchain-based lottery into your ecosystem, or even creating a multicurrency crypto wallet for $HGPT. It's all about empowering your community, just like your DAO voting system. Remember, you're not playing, you're creating. See my profile for demo and details."
