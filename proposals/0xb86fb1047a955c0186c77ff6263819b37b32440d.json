    "proposal": "Hello Wrapped USD community! It's impressive to see how you've created a seamless blend of the 6 USD fiatcoins. With 24 holders in the Arbitrum network, you're clearly on the right track. Have you considered enhancing your community's experience with a DEX or a blockchain-based Lottery? These are just a couple of tools we offer that could align with your vision. See my profile for demo and details."
