    "proposal": "Understanding the SKULL Protocol's unique blend of Ampleforth's economics and YFI's distribution is quite the brain teaser, isn't it? With 77 holders on the ETH network, it's clear you've got a community that's not afraid to hold on tight. Imagine enhancing that grip with our suite of B2B tools, from creating your own DEX to launching a lottery where every community member can be a creator, not just a participant. Let's make holding $SKULL even more rewarding."
