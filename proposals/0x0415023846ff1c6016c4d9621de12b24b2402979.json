    "proposal": "Hey Wombex community! Congrats on reaching 587 holders, that's no small feat. I see you're all about boosting yield and concentrating governance power. How about we add a sprinkle of our B2B tools to that mix? Imagine deploying your own DEX or a blockchain-based lottery. It's all about empowering your WMX tokens and community. See my profile for demo and details."
