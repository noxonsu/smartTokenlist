    "proposal": "Hey there, Affinity community! Congrats on hitting the 12066 holder mark, quite the army you've got there! Your ADAPT solution is a game-changer, making crypto transactions as easy as sharing a username. Now, let's imagine combining that with your own DEX or a blockchain-based lottery, even a multicurrency crypto wallet. Sounds interesting? We offer B2B tools that can make this possible. See my profile for demo and details."
