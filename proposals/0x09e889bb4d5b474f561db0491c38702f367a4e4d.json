    "proposal": "Hey there, CLV Chains community! Congrats on reaching 11415 holders, quite a milestone! Ever thought about empowering those holders even more? With our DEX and Lottery tools, any of you could deploy and share in the revenue. Imagine, your own Uniswap V2 based DEX or a blockchain-based lottery. All while keeping your CLV tokens close in a multicurrency wallet. See my profile for demo and details."
