    "proposal": "Hello BIZ Token community, congrats on reaching 1322 holders! Your vision for a scalable, decentralized system that combines High-Frequency Trading principles with Blockchain Technology is impressive. Our tools could be a great addition to your ecosystem. Fancy a DEX based on Uniswap V2 or a blockchain-based lottery? Maybe a cross-chain bridge or a DAO for governance? All are deployable by any community member. See my profile for demo and details."
