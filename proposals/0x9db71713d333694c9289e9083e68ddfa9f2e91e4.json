    "proposal": "Hey 0xCryptAI community! Noticed you're all about privacy and security in trading and liquidity leasing. With 85 holders on the ETH network, you're clearly making waves. How about we add some tools to your arsenal? Imagine deploying your own DEX or launching a blockchain lottery, all while keeping that core focus on privacy. Let's make privacy not just a feature, but a culture. Thoughts?"
