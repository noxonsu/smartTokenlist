    "proposal": "Hey PLEXUS, Fanton, Laika AI, Axen AI, Evermoon, and Codyfight IGO enthusiasts! Congrats on crossing the 10,102 mark in BSC holders, that's a crowd that could fill a stadium! \ud83c\udf89 Ever thought of harnessing that community power to launch your own DEX or maybe a fun blockchain-based lottery? With our B2B tools, anyone from your community can deploy these and more. Check out my profile for the demo and details. Remember, it's not just about playing, it's about creating."
