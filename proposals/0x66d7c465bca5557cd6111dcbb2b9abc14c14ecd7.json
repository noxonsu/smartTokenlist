    "proposal": "Hello Byron Network enthusiasts! Congrats on reaching 279 holders on the BSC network. You're building a fantastic DeFi ecosystem and we love how the Bynet Wallet is making Cardano more accessible. Now, how about adding a dash of fun? With our Lottery tool, anyone from your community can deploy and earn a commission. Or perhaps a community-run DEX? Just like your BynetDEX, but with a twist - it's entirely your creation! See my profile for demo and details."
