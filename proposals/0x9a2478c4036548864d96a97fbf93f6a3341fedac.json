    "proposal": "Hello ZAX community, congrats on hitting 42361 holders! It's clear you're not just swapping tokens, you're swapping the future of transactions. How about adding a lottery or your own DEX to the mix? With our B2B tools, you could even create a ZAX multicurrency wallet or establish ZAX Yield Farming. Now that would be a Zillion times more interesting. See my profile for demo and details."
