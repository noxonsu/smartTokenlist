    "proposal": "Hello Minter community! Congrats on reaching 873 holders, that's a big milestone! I see you've got a lot going on here with Minter DEX, HUB, and even play-to-earn games. How about adding a lottery to the mix? It's a fun way to engage the community and share revenue. Or perhaps an IDOFactory for launching new tokens? Just a thought! See my profile for demo and details."
