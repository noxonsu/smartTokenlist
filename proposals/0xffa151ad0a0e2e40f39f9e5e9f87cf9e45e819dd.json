    "proposal": "Understanding the vision of Reserve to create a stable, asset-backed currency that's as reliable as traditional money but without the inflation or volatility, we see a world where financial stability is accessible to all. With 41 holders in the ETH network already trusting in this vision, we believe our DEX and Lottery tools can further democratize access to financial tools, allowing anyone in the community to contribute to and benefit from the Reserve ecosystem. Let's make financial inclusivity not just a goal, but a reality."
