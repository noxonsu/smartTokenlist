    "proposal": "Hey there Dusk Network community! With 5568 holders and counting, it's clear you're onto something special. Your vision of bridging the gap between classic and crypto users is impressive. Imagine enhancing it with your own DEX or a blockchain-based lottery? Even better, what if your community members could deploy these tools themselves? They're all possible with our B2B tools. See my profile for demo and details. Let's make finance truly decentralized, together."
