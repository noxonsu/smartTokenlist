    "proposal": "Hey PerlinX community, your project is doing an amazing job democratizing the trading of real-world assets. It's great to see how PERL is functioning both as a liquidity and collateralization asset with 3349 holders already on BSC network. We've got some B2B tools that could align with your vision. Ever thought about deploying your own DEX or perhaps a blockchain-based lottery? It's all about supporting your growth. See my profile for demo and details."
