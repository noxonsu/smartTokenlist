    "proposal": "Hey HomeTokenomics community! Congrats on reaching 423 holders in the ETH network, that's no small feat! Have you ever thought about enhancing your project with a DEX or perhaps a fun lottery? You could even create your own multicurrency crypto wallet or engage in some yield farming. It's all B2B, so it's not just about playing, it's about creating. See my profile for demo and details."
