    "proposal": "Ever seen a pug guard a rug like it's the last one on Earth? That's PUG ON RUG for you, fiercely protecting its space with a no-rug-pull promise. With 47 holders in the ETH network already standing guard, why not let them deploy their own DEX or lottery? Imagine, a community where every pug has its rug and every holder feels like the top dog. Let's make it happen, no \"ifs\" or \"rugs\" about it."
