    "proposal": "Hey Baby Doge Army, with your pawsome community of 5286 holders and growing, have you considered adding a DEX or a blockchain-based lottery to your ecosystem? It could be a fun way for your community to engage more and also, who doesn't love a good game of chess with a side of lottery? It's all B2B, so you're not playing, you're creating. Let me know if interested! See my profile for demo and details."
