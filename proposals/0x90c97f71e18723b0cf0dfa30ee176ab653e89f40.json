    "proposal": "Hello Frax community, congrats on reaching 3651 holders! You've built an impressive decentralized stablecoin infrastructure, and we have some tools that could complement your vision. Think about deploying a DEX or a Lottery to share revenue with your community. Or perhaps, a DAO for enhanced governance? All using your FRAX, FPI, or frxETH tokens. Let's create, not just play. See my profile for demo and details."
