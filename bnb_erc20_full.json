Cryptocurrency trading is the act of speculating on the cryptocurrency price movement through a CFD trading account, or buying and selling basic currencies in exchange. Cryptocurrency markets were fragmented, meaning they were not issued or supported by central authorities such as the government. Instead, they use a computer network. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies only exist as a shared digital ID, which is stored in a blockchain. If a user wants to send cryptocurrency units to another user, he or she sends them to that user's digital wallet.\n\n P2P Trading Platform - Peer trading, commonly known as P2P trading involves trading or buying cryptocurrencies directly from each other. The exchange arranges work for you, and the market price determines your final price at the time of purchase. P2P trading gives you more control over who buys your cryptocurrencies and who you buy from, prices, and payment time. While P2P trading gives users the best control over the process, it is important to note that peer-to-peer transactions carry a certain risk when no third party can sell it to you.\n\nAnother advantage of using it is that it gives you access to the global market for cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. is located in more than 180 countries. You can buy and sell cryptocurrencies with people around the world in just a few seconds.\n\n Metaverse Trading - Metaverse has great potential to transform our way of life, providing a visual space that makes it difficult to distinguish between digital and reality.\n\nThe development of metaverses has accelerated in the post-epidemic period as communication over the internet has become more common and the need for expanded use cases has grown. Metaverse is actually a physical, augmented, and visual integration, and blurs the line between your online interactions and real life.\n\n Metaverse Event Handling - Hosting events in the metaverse have grown significantly over the past 12 months. While Facebook was turning to Meta, the concept of metaverse aroused public interest. The term not only stuck in people's minds but also perpetuated a level of intrigue in a way that had never been seen before. What are some of the key benefits of hosting events in the metaverse?\n\nAccessibility:\n\nDespite what many may believe, almost everyone can join a non-reality event.

Without a bank account,\nthey cannot get their credit scores based on their asset status and credit\ninformation,\nand that causes them to depend on money lenders\nwith high interest rates, resulting in making their situation worse.\n\nHowever, do they really need banks in this Internet age?\n\nWhat is necessary is not a bank account, but the access to financial services.\nIf what is asked for is the creation of rights and opportunities that can be obtained\nby having access to financial services,\nthen that is a problem that can be solved by FinTech and not by banks.\n\nIn addition, based on examples of implementation so far, microfinancing has been\nconfirmed to have extremely high rates of repayment but there are various hindrances\nsuch as a huge capital and the cooperation of megabanks. Under existing conditions,\nvery few people can get an opportunity to get microfinancing.\n\nTo deal with such problems, people all over the world need to work together\nfor future market development, and if we place ourselves not in a country\u2019s or company\u2019s point of view,\nbut in an individual\u2019s point of view, taking action with just by a dedicated spirit is difficult.\nHowever, if we add the motive of mining then we can completely turn around the situation.\nIt is possible for WPC to solve these problems.\n\nWPC is a massive project that will make \u201cWorld Peace\u201d a reality, through the\nmind shift from volunteering to investing.\nThe spread of WPC could change the world economy.\nThank you for reading to the very end. We hope more investors will aim for the\nworld peace together with us.\n\n Notice of Airdrops - If you are holding 3000 WPC or more at bitcastle as of the 22nd of February,\n2019, you will be eligible for WPC airdrops.\nDon\u2019t miss this opportunity!\n\n Information regarding listing on a centralized exchange - We are pleased to inform you that World Peace Coin as listed on COINZEUS !\n\n BENRI Company Limited - The WP Project has established a joint venture \"BENRI Company Limited\" with\nPaygrergate Co., Ltd, which supports Myanmar's financial infrastructure, We\nwill strive to disseminate World Peace Coin step by step starting from\nMyanmar.\n\n AIR DROP - World Peace Coin will conduct Airdrop!\nWe plan to have Airdrop more than once depending on the WPC balance of Wallet\nin bitCastle.\nWe will announce the implementation schedule and distribution conditions in\nthe near future.\n\n Reopened after renovation - WorldPeaceCoin.io has finished its ICO and has been reborn as a page for\nmanagement reports of WP projects and WPC.\nWe will make progress reports on how your investment will change the world at\nany time.\n\n Updates - Notice of Airdrops\n\nIf you are holding 3000 WPC or more at bitcastle as of the 22nd of February,\n2019, you will be eligible for WPC airdrops.\nDon\u2019t miss this opportunity!\n\nInformation regarding listing on a centralized exchange\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that World Peace Coin as listed on COINZEUS !\n\nBENRI Company Limited\n\nThe WP Project has established a joint venture \"BENRI Company Limited\" with\nPaygrergate Co., Ltd, which supports Myanmar's financial infrastructure, We\nwill strive to disseminate World Peace Coin step by step starting from\nMyanmar.\n\nAIR DROP\n\nWorld Peace Coin will conduct Airdrop!\nWe plan to have Airdrop more than once depending on the WPC balance of Wallet\nin bitCastle.\nWe will announce the implementation schedule and distribution conditions in\nthe near future.\n\nReopened after renovation\n\nWorldPeaceCoin.io has finished its ICO and has been reborn as a page for\nmanagement reports of WP projects and WPC.\nWe will make progress reports on how your investment will change the world at\nany time.\n\n"

We have decided to postpone the CEX Launch date, and go traditional route with Pre-Sale, DEX (Pancake Swap), and then CEX. We are in no hurry, we are a utility and we want to make sure the final eSignature product works well with our Web3 Dapp.\n\n Existing users with internal wallets - Existing users with internal wallets have seen their BETA Testing CERTICOS Token replaced with our Live CERT Tokens. Users will be required to add BNB to their accounts to conduct transactions; and may go to their profile and use their internal wallet in MetaMask or other external wallet by using their private key in Profile Settings.\n\n New Sign Up users after that time - New Sign Up users after that time will have the option of using their external wallet or going through KYC for internal based on their type of email (No Gmail, No Yahoo, No Hotmail, etc\u2026). Must be an email tied to their company or website.\n\n SCHEDULED PRE-SALE LAUNCH DATE October 30, 2023 - We expect to have our Web3 Wallet SWAP feature rollout to begin by October 21, 2023 with select BEP20 tokens; and pegged stable and other tokens listed below.\n\n Bridge Pegged Tokens - Binance-Peg XRP Token (XRP), Binance-Peg Ethereum Token (ETH), Binance-Peg BSC-USD (BSC-USD), Binance-Peg USD Coin (USDC), Binance-Peg Litecoin Token (LTC), Binance-Peg Dogecoin Token (DOGE), Binance-Peg Cardano Token (ADA), TRON (TRX), Polygon (MATIC)\n\n Web3 App utilizing WalletConnect and Multisig Transactions - Swap Compatible with Binance Smart Chain BNB, Ethereum, USDC, USDT\n\n Single Mode for Creators, and Approvers - None\n\n Airdrop to Build Community - Airdrop to Build Community will be frequently scheduled on Telegram\n\n Enabling Blockchain Certification of Documents - Our ecosystem allows you to upload or create documents and certifications in our document center using our CERTICOS Token including sign-off approval for a fraction of the legacy eSignature Document Services. Easily retrievable and saved to the Certicosign blockchain and encrypted CID location using IPFS (Inter Planetary File Storage).\n\n Become an Authenticator (i.e. Certifier, Appraiser, Inspector) on Certicos - provide your skill set to Creators or Approvers verifying documents or process within your field of expertise.\n\n Certicos Comparison To Legacy eSignature Services - Certicos offers an alternative to legacy online eSignature services. Send eSignature Documents using Web3 App with Multisig approval, or apply for an internal Certicos secure wallet. Ability to send eSignature documents to up to ten (10) other users (Approvers/Authenticators) at same time for approvals; and they will earn Certicos\u2019 DeFI Tokens for participating as well. No more limited transactions, no more paying exorbitant cost for file storage that you will never use, and no monthly fees. Certicos has created an encrypted alternative to legacy file services by placing your documents securely in encrypted IPFS storage using VID01 CID pointer from our blockchain. The two are immutably tied with a unique identifying file name and SHA256 Encryption with the document encrypted title \u2018on chain\u2019 and the pdf CID IPFS asset off chain immutably tied together.\n\n Tokenomics - None\n\n Frequently Asked Questions - None\n\n"

Inspired by EIP-1559, ETHPad will have several deflationary triggers tied to selling, staking and IDO participation.\n\n How it Works - The first two main deflationary mechanisms will be a 10% fee on all token sales, of which 2.5% will be burned and 7.5% rewarded to stakers in ETH. There will also be an option to unstake early that comes with a 25% burn fee. If you wait 21 days to unstake, there is no fee. Additional deflationary mechanisms are in planning and will be introduced in the future.\n\n 12 months of airdrops! - As a show of commitment to our loyal BSCPad and TRONPAD stakers, we will be airdropping 20% of the ETHPad to them over the course of a year.\n\n Participate in the IDO - To participate in the IDO, you must be staking and passed KYC at least 3 hours before the IDO date.\n\n Public Price - $0.0015 BUSD/USDT\n\n Maximum Supply - 1,000,000,000 $ETHPAD\n\n Supply at listing - 37,000,000 $ETHPAD\n\n Initial Market Cap - $55,500 USD\n\n Tokenomics - Team: 11%, Advisors: 6%, Liquidity: 10%, Ecosystem: 9%, Reserve: 3%, Staking/Rewards: 9%, Private Sale: 22%, BSCPad Public: 5%, TronPad Public: 5%, Airdrop: 20%\n\n ETHPad Tiers - Project tokens offered on ETHPad IDOs will be split into the following pools: 10% for lottery Tier (Bronze), 90% for guaranteed allocation Tiers (higher tiers)\n\n Lottery Tier - Bronze\nStake 5000 ETHPad - 1 lottery ticket\nStake 10000 ETHPad - 2 lottery tickets\nStake 15000 ETHPad - 3 lottery tickets\nStake 20000 ETHPad - 4 lottery tickets\nStake 25000 ETHPad - 5 lottery tickets\n\n Guaranteed Allocation Tiers - Silver\n120,000 staked\nPool weight 1\n\nGold\n200,000 staked\nPool weight 2\n\nDiamond\n500,000 staked\nPool weight 5 + Access to Private Sales\n\n ETHPad defining features - The forthcoming update to Ethereum, EIP-1559, will bring deflationary aspects to Ethereum\u2019s tokenomics. Inspired by this, we will be building deflationary mechanisms into ETHPad\u2019s token structure. These burns will be programmatically tied to selling, staking, and IDO participation functions - ensuring a consistent reduction in the total supply over time.\n\n Backed by the full force of the BSCPad marketing department - Since the massively successful launch of BSCPad, we have demonstrated again and again that our team knows how to \u2018move the needle\u2019 with crypto marketing.\n\n Incubator program for new projects - Our new incubator program will select and support the most promising teams and projects, giving them marquee status across our ecosystem of launchpads.\n\n ETHPad Socials - Website: ethpad.network, Telegram: t.me/ethpad, Telegram ANN: t.me/ethpadannouncements, Twitter: twitter.com/ethpadofficial, Medium: medium.com/@ethpad, Support: Contact Support\n\n BSCPad Socials - Website: bscpad.com, Telegram: [Telegram Link]\n\n"

Nevertheless, most of the current Web3 games have been or are planning to be released for PC. It is worth to note that the amount of money spent in the app market exceeds hundreds of billion dollars globally every year, and the trend is continuing to increase.\n\n What We do - Pomerium is developing products to connect web2 and web3 games. NFTs and wallets like Metamask used in web3 games may be quite unfamiliar to gamers in the traditional game market. However, Pomerium believes that providing gamers with the most familiar device environment as well as gaming UX is the best way to make web3 games more popular to users. Pomerium is aiming to provide solutions to onboard web2 games into web3 without any code; first-party DEX and auction; and original game data security protocol linked on-chain <-> off-chain.

Just as Bitcoin releases new BTC every 10 minutes, our staking smart contract pays out BTCBSC tokens in line with this block schedule. Stake BTCBSC to earn these rewards.\n\n BUY BTCBSC in PRESALE at 2011 prices - The presale price of one BTCBSC is only $0.99 per token, a price you could only buy BTC at back in 2011. 29% of the total token supply will be sold in presale or 6,125,000 tokens, making the initial market cap $6,063,750. With a maximum supply of 21,000,000 tokens, the remaining 14,455,000 BTCBSC is reserved for staking rewards.\n\n Stake to earn BTCBSC - Bitcoin BSC will provide passive rewards for all holders who stake their BTCBSC tokens in our smart contract. 69% of the token supply or 14,455,000 tokens will be paid out to participants in the staking pool as rewards every 10 minutes. Buy and stake tokens at any time with a 7-day lock on withdrawals - rewards are based on your percentage of the total staking pool.\n\n BNB Smart Chain Advantage - BNB Smart Chain is built on the code of Ethereum providing both proven security and smart contract capabilities. Save money on gas fees with BNB Smart Chain transactions being both quicker and cheaper than Ethereum. Easily access BTCBSC through your regular Trust Wallet or MetaMask dapps, making it easy to store and trade BTCBSC.\n\n WHITEPAPER - The Bitcoin BSC mission is to allow everyday crypto enthusiasts the chance to buy a new version of Bitcoin at a price that was only available to tech geeks and insiders. Leveraging BNB Smart Chain\u2019s smart contract functionality, BTCBSC promises to deliver on speed, security, and efficiency. Read our whitepaper for more information.\n\n"

Domi introduces a unique cryptographic hash algorithm that timestamps transactions prior to validation, called Proof of Time (PoT). This enhancement along with the Fast Byzantine Agreement (FBA) in the consensus process allows for exponentially faster block validation time. To further enhance security while maintaining unlimited participation and decentralization, we introduce a new decentralized firewall. This hybrid validation model is composed of core nodes and surveillance nodes. The core nodes are solely responsible for block production and validation. Surveillance nodes are only involved with surveillance of the blockchain and endorsement of transactions.\n\n INSPIRATION - Our objective at Domi is to create the world\u2019s fastest, most secure decentralized network that can be implemented in both public and private sectors.\n\n"

Blockchain is the underlying technology, functioning as a \u2018ledger\u2019 or record of transactions made. Hundreds of currencies are in circulation, such as Bitcoin, Ether, Monero, etc. Each is designed by one or more brilliant individuals, usually meant to run as a decentralised system so that no single entity can control it. Cryptocurrency units are usually generated on the basis of an algorithm announced to everyone in advance, by \u2018miners\u2019 using powerful computers. Having expended a lot of time and electricity on \u2018mining\u2019, these miners can hold on to the units or sell to others.\n\n How to start trading in cryptocurrencies? - Fundamentally, a seller sells their currency to gain cash and a buyer buys expecting to hold the currency until its value increases in dollar/rupee terms. In mid-August 2021, the total market value of all cryptocurrency exceeded $2 trillion, with Bitcoin alone making up 44% of that. As the graph above shows, a currency can start small and reach very high \u2013 but with a number of bumps along the way. People with a lot of faith in the future of cryptocurrencies subscribe to a \u2018HODL\u2019 mindset, meaning \u2018hold on for dear life\u2019 to the roller-coaster they expect to ride.\n\n What is the purpose of cryptocurrency? - As indicated by \u2018currency\u2019, they were originally intended to be used in the same way as rupees and dollars are, as a medium of payment between people for products and services purchased.\n\n What is the affiliate Program? - Affiliate Program is an opportunity for our members to earn some extra income by inviting other people to open an investment account with us.\n\n"

Connecting to Polkadot gives you the ability to interoperate with a wide variety of blockchains in the Polkadot network.\n\n Economic & transactional scalability - Polkadot provides unprecedented economic scalability by enabling a common set of validators to secure multiple blockchains. Polkadot provides transactional scalability by spreading transactions across multiple parallel blockchains.\n\n Easy blockchain innovation - Create a custom blockchain in minutes using the Substrate framework. Connect your chain to Polkadot and get interoperability and security from day one. This ease of development helps Polkadot\u2019s network grow.\n\n High energy efficiency - Polkadot consumes a small fraction of the energy used by conventional blockchains thanks to its next-generation nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) model. Using the equivalent of ~6.6 US households worth of energy per year, Polkadot has the lowest carbon footprint among proof-of-stake protocols analyzed in recent research.\n\n Security for everyone - Polkadot's novel data availability and validity scheme allows chains to interact with each other in a meaningful way. Chains remain independent in their governance, but united in their security.\n\n User-driven governance - Polkadot has a sophisticated governance system where all stakeholders have a voice.

All privileges, which on other platforms are exclusive to miners will be given to the Relay Chain participants (DOT holders), including managing exceptional events such as protocol upgrades and fixes.\n\n Staking - Token holders keep the network secure and collect rewards by staking DOT. Polkadot\u2019s advanced staking system is designed for maximum decentralization and fair representation, rewarding good actors and punishing bad actors to ensure network security.\n\n Bonding - New parachains are added by bonding tokens. Outdated or non-useful parachains are removed by removing bonded tokens. This is a form of proof of stake.\n\n Polkadot is an open-source project founded by the Web3 Foundation. - Web3 Foundation has commissioned five teams and over 100 developers to build Polkadot, including: ChainSafe, Parity Technologies, Polkadot JS, Soramitsu.\n\n From the blog - Polkadot enjoyed further ecosystem growth in the third quarter of 2023, with impressive metrics around staking, on-chain events and unique accounts.\n\n Fungible Assets on Asset Hub - A technical deep-dive into fungible assets and multilocations on Asset Hub.\n\n How Polkadot's Blockspace Empowers Developers - Discover how Polkadot's blockspace can address blockchain development challenges and empower developers to create, innovate, and thrive.\n\n"

A verified staking contract will release BTCB tokens in line with the original Bitcoin block rewards schedule. Stake BTCB and earn a percentage of these rewards through a new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\n buying (BTCB) - Buying BTC at $1.0672 was impossible for the majority of people, but today you can buy BTCB for exactly that price. Don\u2019t miss out this time!\n\n Connect - First, you must create an account, or if you have an account, you can log in to your account.\n\n Swap - Pay for your BTCB tokens with ETH on (BNB Smart Chain) or BNB on BNB Chain. You can also pay with USDT on either of these two networks. Remember to keep enough ETH or BNB in your wallet to pay for gas.\n\n Claim - You\u2019ll be able to claim your BTCB tokens at the end of the presale period before the project goes public. Dates for claim and launch will be announced. Claiming will be on the (BNB Smart Chain) network.\n\n ROADMAP - BTCB follows a path inspired by the historic journey of Bitcoin driven forward by the innovation of staking for passive income.\n\n 2025 Onwards. - Phase 4: Long-Term Sustainability\n\n($BTCB) aims to achieve long-term sustainability. The staking contract will continue to reward ($BTCB) tokens to stakers in alignment with the Bitcoin release schedule, extending over a span of approximately 120 years. This gradual token release mechanism ensures a fair and measured distribution of rewards, providing enduring incentives for long-term community engagement.\n\n 2023 Q3-Q4. - Phase 1: Presale and Token Distribution\n\nDuring the initial pre-sale, a total of 5,210,000 tokens (BTCB) will be offered at a token price of $0.30 each, aiming to reflect Bitcoin's market cap in 2010.\n\nOnce the pre-sale reaches its maximum allocation of 5,210,000 tokens, the funds raised will be utilized to lay the foundation for further development, marketing efforts, and strategic partnerships.\n\n 2023 Q4-Q1. - Phase 2: Launch and Staking Activation\n\nFollowing the presale, the ($BTCB) team will deploy a secure and immutable staking contract. This contract will lock all unsold tokens (minimum of 15,790,000 BTCB ), serving as the cornerstone of the token's staking mechanism. Users will have the opportunity to stake their ($BTCB) tokens and participate in the distribution of staking rewards.\n\n 2024 Q1-Q4. - Phase 3: Development and Expansion\n\nThe ($BTCB) team will focus on continuous development and expansion of the project. Key objectives include enhancing the staking contract's security and efficiency, exploring potential partnerships with strategic players, and expanding the utility of ($BTCB) within decentralized applications.\n\n"

            "summary": "Proof of Person Blockchain - VC, whales and staking pools dominate blockchain governance and monopolize mining taking away block rewards from individuals and making independent mining meaningless. Most blockchains have failed to maintain decentralization and turned into plutocracy.\n\n Encouraging individuals - To increase network diversity Idena provides higher returns for smaller stakes. Individual APY is always higher than the APY of staking pools or richer accounts.\n\n Why proof of personhood - Unlike PoS and PoW blockchains, to become a validator Idena requires you to prove that you are a unique person. Proof of Personhood allows you to maximize rewards as an individual miner and prevents the concentration of capital in staking pools.\n\n Maximize individual rewards - Increase your rewards by optimizing the amount of your stake. Identity staking allows you to earn higher returns as an independent miner compared to being part of a staking pool. This prevents capital concentration and promotes individual mining.\n\n Prove your personhood - No personal data is needed, simply prove your uniqueness\n\n Run Idena node - Earn rewards by running your very first mining node\n\n It\u2019s easy - You don\u2019t need to be a tech expert to install the mining node on your PC\n\n Low costs - Run the node on your home computer, laptop or Raspberry Pi\n\n Eco-friendly - No GPU or mining rigs needed, no high electricity usage\n\n What is Idena - Idena is one of the many players out there making an earnest try at creating more Sybil-resistance\n\n Technology - Idena, the first Proof-of-Person blockchain, is live since 2019. Idena validators are coordinated on the basis of a 1-person-1-vote consensus. Security is ensured by the variety of validators and a minimum threshold for stake to be eligible to vote.\n\n Scalability and decentralization - The throughput of the 1-person-1-vote blockchain can be enhanced by increasing the number of independent validators. A sharded network of validators enables parallel processing of more transactions. In contrast, money-based blockchains achieve scalability through greater centralization.\n\n Identity contracts - Identity primitive is natively integrated into Idena smart contracts. Idena enables identity staking for any IRC20 token. You can use it for airdrops or building plutocracy-resistant DAOs based on token-backed identities. Build DApps using Idena Oracles as a decentralized gateway to access real world data.\n\n AI-resistance - The difficulty of FLIP-tests increases over time. On one hand, participants are encouraged to create AI-resistant FLIPs. On the other hand, these FLIPs are used to train a friendly AI. The friendly AI is to help participants to filter out trivial flips, making it more challenging for hostile AIs to attack the system.\n\n Pillars of decentralization - 1-person-1-vote coupled with higher returns for smaller stakers mitigate dominance of the rich and stimulate network diversity. Identity staking serves against the buying/selling accounts, identity farming, and coercive validation. Human creativity boosted by accessible AI tools is to withstand attacks from hostile AI-bots.\n\n"

The seller first delivers the domain to us, then we send you your tailored transfer instructions. Need help? Our domain ownership transfer specialists will assist you at no additional cost.\n\n Hassle free payments - Pay by bank wire and get a 1% discount or use one of the most popular payment options available through our payment processor, Adyen. Adyen is the payment platform of choice for many leading tech companies like Uber & eBay.\n\n Value Added Tax - The Value Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax applied in the European Union (EU) to all goods and services.\n\n Estimate in USD - This amount is an estimate based on the most recent currency conversion rate.\n\n Lease to own conditions - USD $1,528\n\nMonthly Payment\n\nMonths\n\n Price overview - Full ownership after 18 months\n\nLong term service fee 10 %\n\nTotal purchase price 27,500\n\n Use the domain shortly after payment - After the first payment, our system automatically transfers the domain to our own holding registrar to keep it safe and available for you.

This is only available for buyers. Sellers can\u2019t cancel the contract, as long as you do not miss any final monthly payment deadline(s). When you opt to cancel a transaction, the received installments will be kept by the seller. You won\u2019t receive the ownership of the domain and the domain will be returned to the original seller.\n\n Long term service fee - Long term service fee is a fee percentage added when you pick a period longer than 1 year. The fee is included in the price you see in the Lease to own dialog.\n\n The simple, safe way to buy domain names - No matter what kind of domain you want to buy or lease, we make the transfer simple and safe.\n\n Seller's notes about New-Gold.com - Yes this domain is expensive, just like everything else; so let me ask you this:\n\nWhat is the value of a click that generates a 10,000,000USD jet sale?What is the value of a click that generates a 1,000,000USD home sale?What is the value of a click that generates a 100,000USD consulting project?What is the value of a click that sells a 10,000USD vehicle?\n\nWhat is the value of a DOMAIN that generates tens, hundreds, thousands etc of clicks/referrals each month FOREVER?\n\nWhat is the LIFE TIME VALUE of a NEW CUSTOMER FOR YOUR BUSINESS?\n\nSomething to think about.\n\nHAVE A NICE DAY! ~ RogueFishMedia\n\n"

Appropriate treatment of Heart Alert patients includes accurate identification of the infarction and early activation of the heart catheterization team.\n\n Uncommon Dinner Guests - What happens when you invite roughly 100 hospital administrators, physicians, nurses, and paramedics from competing organizations to the same dinner? It's exciting!\n\n A Small Part in a Huge Initiative - The Infectious Disease Response Unit Advisory Committee consists of some of the greatest minds in public health and infectious disease doctors. This advisory committee was formed to help guide preparedness and response activities in the great state of Texas in preparation of and response to incidents with the potential to spread high consequence infectious disease(s).\n\n Spine Board Study - STRAC Members collaborate on a research project to determine the effectiveness of spinal immobilization without the use of a spine board. This study is specifically targeted to determine the amount of spinal movement (or lack there of) experienced by a simulated trauma patient under C-spine precautions while immobilized to an EMS stretcher.\n\n 30 Seconds Is All It Takes - What started as a goal to improve ER to EMS relationships as well as improving the process of transfer of care has resulted in a new practice that is sweeping the nation. The EMS \"Time Out\" increases patient safety and improves communications between the EMS provider and the nurse who continues patient care at the receiving hospital.\n\n CEOs Care About Perinatal Care - During this CEO Advisory Board meeting, Chief Executive Officers brought perinatal leadership from their respective hospital systems to discuss the uniform designations for levels of maternity care that are complimentary but distinct from levels of neonatal care and that address maternal health needs, thereby reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in the united states.\n\n Immediate Responders... Not Bystanders - No matter how rapid the arrival of professional emergency responders, bystanders will always be first on the scene. A person who is bleeding can die from blood loss within five minutes, therefore it is important to quickly stop the blood loss.\n\n Regional Mass Fatality Planning - State designated trauma centers in Trauma Service Area - P participated in the regional Mass Fatality Concept of Operations Planning Workshop to improve resilience from and response to man-made and natural disasters.\n\n April Pool's Day - STRAC is proud to be part of the WATCH Coalition for Water Safety. Every year STRAC participates in an annual public outreach event called April Pools Day. STRAC and Member organizations such as the Methodist Healthcare System, San Antonio Fire Department, San Antonio Military Medical Center, University Health System, and many more disseminate water safety information, tips, and safety literature to help raise water safety awareness in the community every year on April 1st.\n\n Bringing It Together - One of the benefits to being a member of STRAC is the ability to collaborate with and learn from other agencies throughout the emergency healthcare system to improve system processes, procedures, and protocols. This is one of the many ways our members improve patient care throughout Southwest Texas.\n\n More Than Bragging Rights - Hospital Decontamination Teams from across the region compete for the title of DECON Rodeo Champion every year but that is not all. Throughout the year hospitals across this vast 26,000 square mile region in Southwest Texas refresh personal protective equipment inventories, maintain various respirator supplies, and test decontamination equipment while improving muscle memory and increasing hospital response capabilities to better support the communities in which they serve.\n\n Fall Awareness Lengthens Lives - Hospital and EMS members of STRAC are active participants in the Texas Falls Prevention Coalition and host F.A.L.L. courses in the community all year long. Objectives of the Fall Awareness Lengthens Lives (FALL) course developed by STRAC's Regional Injury Prevention Committee include:\n\n- Identification of slip, trip, and fall hazards\n- Discuss ways to avoid injuries and the importance of movement\n\n"

            "summary": "Why Neutron - Powered by Tendermint and built with the Cosmos SDK, Neutron is the most secure permission-less smart contract platform for Interchain DeFi. Neutron lets developers launch smart-contracts based applications that can scale across the Interchain, a network of 50+ blockchains connected via IBC.\n\n What are Interchain Accounts? - Interchain Accounts (ICA) lets Cosmos blockchains control accounts (aka \u201cwallets\u201d) on remote zones via IBC, instead of local private keys, and write transactions that can be executed on the remote chain. Neutron will be both a \u201chost\u201d and a \u201ccontroller\u201d and will launch with a custom implementation that makes Interchain Accounts available to smart contracts. It means smart contracts on Neutron will be able to interact with modules and zones from other ICA-enabled Cosmos chains and vice versa.\n\n What are Interchain Queries? - Interchain Queries (ICQs) let developers securely retrieve data from remote zones via specific modules and IBC. Neutron\u2019s implementation is unique because it uses smart contracts instead of modules to process raw data into elegant data structures. It makes Neutron\u2019s Interchain Queries much faster and easier to update, ensuring a more comprehensive range of supported ICQs and continued compatibility with the supported zones.\n\n What is CosmWasm? - Neutron features native support for CosmWasm, a virtual machine that allows smart contracts written in Rust, AssemblyScript, and other coding languages to run on Cosmos blockchains. CosmWasm smart contracts have significant benefits over an Appchain\u2019s binary: they benefit from an extensive library of testing tools, are easier to deploy and upgrade, and can be audited more efficiently.\n\n What are the benefits of permissionlessness? - Being permission-less means, smart contracts can launch on Neutron without the need to be whitelisted via a governance vote. It makes Neutron more scalable, neutral, and competitive: Fast deployment, Streamlined governance, Neutrality.\n\n"

DAPP basically provide a decentralized exchange service through which people can earn a good amount of money by buying and exchanging crypto coins on daily basis or by holding them.\n\n Decentralised Exchange - As the world evolves towards more digital solutions, decentralised exchanges are growing in popularity. Users have a safe and effective way to trade cryptocurrencies without depending on a third party thanks to decentralised exchanges. Due to the fact that users are not required to divulge any personal information or keep their assets on the exchange, they also give greater privacy than centralised exchanges.\n\n NFT MARKETPLACE - NFT is a non-fungible token means these are digital assets registered on a blockchain having their unique identifiers. An NFT marketplace is a platform that facilitates the buying and selling of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), unique digital assets that are verified on a blockchain. NFT marketplaces are often integrated with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, allowing for the buying, selling, and trading of NFTs using cryptocurrencies and other digital assets within a decentralized, trustless environment.\n\n Burning Protocol - The Burning Protocol is a technique for Controlling Token Supply in a decentralised economy. It entails producing a certain quantity of tokens and \"burning\" them by sending them to an invalid address. When users pay in USDT to Mint New NFTs , the money are utilised to acquire and burn tokens, lowering the supply and Boosting the value of the remaining Tokens. When supply falls, demand for the token rises, potentially resulting to an increase in the token's price. The Burning Protocol encourages users to keep their tokens, increasing their value over time.\n\n Create and sell your NFTs - Set up your wallet, Mint & Burn, Stake & Promote, Swap\n\n Distribution Protocol - A NFT (non-fungible token) distribution mechanism usually entails producing a limited amount of unique digital assets, validating ownership using blockchain technology, and making them available for purchase or transfer. This can be accomplished through the use of markets, auctions, or direct sales. NFTs may represent a wide range of digital material, including art, music, and video games. The distribution system for NFTs frequently includes restrictions governing the digital asset's transferability and use rights, which are enforced via smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\n"

Without a bank account,\nthey cannot get their credit scores based on their asset status and credit\ninformation,\nand that causes them to depend on money lenders\nwith high interest rates, resulting in making their situation worse.\n\nHowever, do they really need banks in this Internet age?\n\nWhat is necessary is not a bank account, but the access to financial services.\nIf what is asked for is the creation of rights and opportunities that can be obtained\nby having access to financial services,\nthen that is a problem that can be solved by FinTech and not by banks.\n\nIn addition, based on examples of implementation so far, microfinancing has been\nconfirmed to have extremely high rates of repayment but there are various hindrances\nsuch as a huge capital and the cooperation of megabanks. Under existing conditions,\nvery few people can get an opportunity to get microfinancing.\n\nTo deal with such problems, people all over the world need to work together\nfor future market development, and if we place ourselves not in a country\u2019s or company\u2019s point of view,\nbut in an individual\u2019s point of view, taking action with just by a dedicated spirit is difficult.\nHowever, if we add the motive of mining then we can completely turn around the situation.\nIt is possible for WPC to solve these problems.\n\nWPC is a massive project that will make \u201cWorld Peace\u201d a reality, through the\nmind shift from volunteering to investing.\nThe spread of WPC could change the world economy.\nThank you for reading to the very end.

            "summary": "Meta Apes Ready for Takeoff! - Become part of the strongest Clan, create your own Gang, fight other apes, and be the first monkey to explore the galaxy!\n\n Cooperation - Choose to be part of an elite pack of monkeys, in one of the 6 legendary Clans\nProtect and lead convoys of precious resources to power up your Rocket!\nFight monkeys from other Clans and take part in massive PVP wars!\nMake friends with other players of your Gang!\n\n STRATEGY - Build or hijack convoys of resources from other Clans\nDevelop your outpost to dominate the monkey world\nCreate your own army and train the most powerful monkeys!\nPlan to get ahead of the other Clans in the Rocket race!\n\n EXPLORATION - From Roger the Intendant to Junior one of the powerful Clan Leaders, meet our cast of awesome monkeys\nExplore a post-apocalyptic world full of surprises\nFight PVE battles against the terrifying Mutant Monkeys\nTravel all around the map, discover ancient Ruins, and huge Bosses!\n\n What is Meta Apes? - Meta Apes is a free-to-play, play-and-earn MMO strategy game. It is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in which humanity has ended and a new era ruled by Apes has begun. Next on the agenda is space domination. Each pri-mate (yes, you) will have to work closely with their Gang to become the strongest Clan and win the ultimate race to space.\n\n Why is Meta Apes using blockchain technology? - We think that you, as a player and a consumer, are entitled to not only greater transparency, ownership, and freedom, but also a genuinely fun gaming experience with a narrative and a community. Meta Apes aims to deliver all of these. In addition, tokenization would enable transferability of in-game assets across the evolving Meta Apes galaxy.\n\n How is Meta Apes different from other games? - The biggest differences between Meta Apes and another web2 mobile game are decentralization and ownership. This means the game-related data lives on the blockchain instead of a centralized server that is fully controlled by the game studio and as such the players are able to truly own the assets that they earn from investing their time and/or resources into. With true ownership, players are then able to trade or sell these assets freely and also earn while playing.\n\n What are some of the key components of the gameplay? - Building | Grow your city via resource production & management, training & research\nCompetition | Fight PvP & PvE battles to lead your Clan to victory\nCommunity | Collaborate and strategize with other pri-mates in your Gang\nExploration | Travel all around the map and discover a world full of surprises\n\n What platforms is Meta Apes currently available on? - Meta Apes is a mobile game supporting both Android & iOS and available on Google Play & App Store\n\n What blockchain does Meta Apes use? - Meta Apes runs on BNB Application Sidechain (BAS), which allows us to have our own chain dedicated to Meta Apes only (Ape Chain). In fact, we\u2019re the first game to launch on BAS!\n\n Do I need to buy an NFT to start playing the game? - No, you do not need an NFT to start playing the game! The game is free-to-play for anyone with a mobile device, and non-NFT Fighters can still be acquired via regular in-game activities.\n\n What exactly are the advantages of having an NFT fighter (vs. non-NFT fighter)? - First, NFT fighters generate SHELL, which is the utility token and in-game currency in Meta Apes. The amount of SHELL generated will depend on the rarity of the NFT fighter. Second, they come equipped with more skills and will have 1-3 extra skills in addition to the default skills available for non-NFT fighters. Additionally, each skill will also have increased strength and power. Besides additional skills and power, they also come with special effects that make your fighters more fun! Lastly, having an NFT fighter will help you identify which second fighter would create the strongest and the most powerful bond when paired with your existing NFT fighter. As of today, there are 3 different types of rarity available for the NFT fighters.\n\n I just bought an NFT from Galler - how do I transfer my NFT fighter from BSC to Ape Chain? - Please visit our marketplace (https://plat.metaapesgame.com/index) to access the Celer bridge, which will enable you to transfer your NFTs from BSC to Ape Chain (BAS) and use them in the game.\n\n Tell us more about your tokenomics. - Meta Apes has a dual token model - SHELL (utility token) and PEEL (governance & gas token). SHELL is the utility token that serves as the in-game currency. It is primarily generated by holding NFT fighters but can also be earned via in-game rewards or purchased via in-app-purchases. PEEL is the governance & native gas token. All NFT purchases will be used to buy back & burn PEEL. Additionally, PEEL token holders will be able to stake their PEEL and spend it on select critical in-game activities, such as the final upgrade of the NFT fighter. We will also reward PEEL to top performing & contributing clans and players. PEEL will be officially introduced in the coming months (not part of the mainnet game launch).\n\n Can you tell us a bit more about the roadmap? - The roadmap for Meta Apes includes various updates and features that will be released in the future. Please stay tuned for more information.\n\n"

Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralized development.\n\n Why Use Bitcoin Cash? - With Bitcoin Cash, you can send money to anyone, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Like the Internet itself, the network is always on. No transaction is too big or too small. And you never need anyone\u2019s permission or approval.\n\n Benefits for Merchants - The network fee for a typical Bitcoin Cash transaction is less than one penny. If you want to convert your BCH into fiat currency, such as US dollars, you can do that through merchant processors for a cost that is still much lower than credit card processing.\n\n The History of Bitcoin Cash - In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the famous whitepaper entitled 'Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System'. In 2009, he released the first bitcoin software that powered the network, and it operated smoothly for several years with low fees, and fast, reliable transactions.\n\n Decentralized Development - With multiple independent teams of developers providing software implementations, the future is secure. Bitcoin Cash is resistant to political and social attacks on protocol development. No single group or project can control it. Multiple implementations also provides redundancy to ensure that the network retains 100% uptime.\n\n"

Polkastarter is a platform that connects young projects with early community members through initial decentralized offerings or IDOs. During an IDO, a project will distribute tokens to community members (aka IDO participants) in exchange for funding. Thus, projects get to raise capital and grow the community, and participants get in (very) early to high-upside potential tokens.

Modern games nowadays not only stop at regular gameplay but also create a virtual world that is competitive between players where they spend most of their time immersing themselves in this world. The financial demographic in the game industry is really basic, most of the revenue comes from players paying for game products to have a chance to experience and to assert themselves in the virtual world. The global gaming industry revenue is estimated to be over $120 billion by 2021, which shows a shocking growth, however, one thing that everyone sees is that the final cash flow will eventually belong to the developers, players don\u2019t really possess any assets, they are basically paying to have an interesting experience.\n\n GameFi - A new definition was born when combining blockchain and gaming, created a chance for players to really possess assets and to be able to exchange assets with other players. In-game assets are NFTs that players have full control over, besides, they can earn more income like an actual job. A new game theory is when the revenue is shared for both players and developers. The development of a game product depends on the contribution of 3 parties: Investors, Developers, and Players. With the thriving Blockchain gaming area that has a large number of Investors and Gamers\u2019 interest, NFT Games has been and is motivating a more powerful economy where players have the control. Big game studios definitely cannot miss the boat for this revolution, which is why we are so determined to create such a quality product and to assert ourselves in this area.\n\n"

To help promote adoption of Breakout Coin, a reserve of 7,000,000 BRK is held by the coin company to be lent to vendors to help them promote their business as well as adoption of BRK. Loan disbursements are made over time and have strict clauses that forbid the recipients from selling coins on exchanges. Loans are intended to be used for such things as award points or incentives. Terms of the loans encourage the borrower to be a net buyer in the open market and does not penalize in the event that BRK price increases significantly during the repayment period.\n\n Unique hybrid blockchain - Breakout Chain is a hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (PoW/PoS) blockchain. Unlike other PoW/PoS hybrids, however, in Breakout Chain, the two different security systems emit two different coins. Whereas PoS emits Breakout Coin (by staking Breakout Stake), the PoW emits Sister Coin.

Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web based on the blockchain. which incorporates concepts including decentralization and token-based economics. Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web 2.0, wherein they say data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as \"Big Tech\" The term was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and the idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large technology companies, and venture capital firms. Many Web3 developers have chosen to build dapps because of Ethereum's inherent decentralization: Anyone who is on the network has permission to use the service \u2013 or in other words, permission isn't required. No one can block you or deny you access to the service. Payments are built in via the native token, ether (ETH). Ethereum is turing-complete, meaning you can pretty much program anything.\n\n Why would I use Bitcoin Web3 rather than a traditional bank? - For value and values. 1. Your money works harder for you, because we cut out the costs of the bank middleman. 2. It is more efficient. 3. Users become owners. When you use our products, you are awarded a share of our community organization, the DeFi Bridge DAO. 4. Most importantly, Bitcoin Web3 is a bank alternative built for you. Built for people who want their money to work harder for them.

The company does thorough due diligence and reserves the right to accept new members at its discretion.\n\n How do I join Bitcoin Web3? - We have two apps: a web app and a mobile app. Both are currently in a test phase and are progressively being rolled out to new users. Our shareholder community (holders of Bitcoin Web3) have preferential access as well as selected other individuals with an invite code. Click the Sign up button to be added to the waitlist.

Without a bank account,\nthey cannot get their credit scores based on their asset status and credit\ninformation,\nand that causes them to depend on money lenders\nwith high interest rates, resulting in making their situation worse.\n\nHowever, do they really need banks in this Internet age?\n\nWhat is necessary is not a bank account, but the access to financial services.\nIf what is asked for is the creation of rights and opportunities that can be obtained\nby having access to financial services,\nthen that is a problem that can be solved by FinTech and not by banks.\n\nIn addition, based on examples of implementation so far, microfinancing has been\nconfirmed to have extremely high rates of repayment but there are various hindrances\nsuch as a huge capital and the cooperation of megabanks. Under existing conditions,\nvery few people can get an opportunity to get microfinancing.\n\nTo deal with such problems, people all over the world need to work together\nfor future market development, and if we place ourselves not in a country\u2019s or company\u2019s point of view,\nbut in an individual\u2019s point of view, taking action with just by a dedicated spirit is difficult.\nHowever, if we add the motive of mining then we can completely turn around the situation.\nIt is possible for WPC to solve these problems.\n\nWPC is a massive project that will make \u201cWorld Peace\u201d a reality, through the\nmind shift from volunteering to investing.\nThe spread of WPC could change the world economy.\nThank you for reading to the very end.

The revolutionary global payments network is based on a completely decentralised, peer-to-peer, open source protocol representing a way to move money or value, faster, cheaper and more efficiently than the mediums that are traditionally available.\n\n How to Keep Bitcoins Safe - The growing use of bitcoins is leading to entrepreneurial innovation and changes in traditional banking infrastructure. Once the infrastructure is built and there is mass distribution of the currency, new businesses can build financial services without having to invest in expensive infrastructure, all that will be required is to build applications and supportive services without the need for a data centre, massive hardware, and an IT department.\n\n How to Trade Bitcoin - Bitcoin has grown fast since its inception. With a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins (BTC) to be generated by 2140, a lot of people assume there are still a lot of coins to be mined for the next few years. While that is true up to a certain extent, it is estimated that by January, 2018 eighty percent of the finite supply will have been brought into circulation already.\n\n Bitcoin Exchanges - The coming year could become a very important one for Bitcoin as a whole, even without guarantees or certainties. We will be tracking changes both positive or negative.\n\n Difference Between Bitcoin, FOREX & Gold - This website will also help you learn how to trade bitcoins.

It is permissionless to submit soft proposals on the BitDAO forum, and official proposals on the BitDAO Governance Module (Snapshot). It is permissionless to hold $BIT, delegate $BIT, and vote on proposals.\n\n Resource Management - The BitDAO treasury grows through net inflows from BIT powered products, the increasing value of assets held in the treasury or off-chain, and contributions from Bybit. The BitDAO treasury allocates resources to fund the development and adoption of BIT powered products, specialized initiatives, liquidity support and BIT purchase programs, and token swaps with other organizations.\n\n Principles - BitDAO is not a company. It does not have a management team or employees. BitDAO is a collection of builders and stakeholders who hold $BIT tokens and are motivated to make the project a success. Holding $BIT entitles holders to submit and vote on proposals. It does not entitle holders to impose their will upon other contributors. Partnerships or $BIT use-cases that are sponsored by others do not require a governance proposal.\n\n"

Instead, any forthcoming airdrops from the NFT will be transferred to the new owner\nTokenomics Distribution: Funds from minting allocated to liquidity provision, development initiatives (including CEX listing), marketing, buyback NFTs, and more\nSmart Contract Features: 3.3% royalties on secondary markets; 4 rarity levels with increasing staking bonuses (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)\n\n OGMF Token - Transaction Tax: 1.5% on purchases, 1.5% on sales\nTokenomics Distribution: 70% of tax revenue used for buybacks and burning tokens; 30% allocated to team funding, marketing, and future development\nUtility: Staking NFTs and tokens rewards users with token drops\n\n Tokenomics - Our token model is designed to be permanently deflationary, as reflected in our tokenomics.\n\n TGE Market Cap - $138,000\n\n Liquidity Lock - $190,000+-\n\n FDV - 525K\n\n TGE Distribution - 33.3% (no lockup)\n2 months vesting for remaining supply\n60%\nNFT Holders Airdrop\n27%\nLiquidity Pool\n8%\nMarketing/Listings\n5%\nReserve\n\n OGMF Burn Projections - \n\n Goals and Community - Our objective is to establish a robust community and elevate the recognition of piracy on a global scale, while promoting the culture of seafaring. We strive to remain steadfast in our commitment to transparency.\n\n Team and Developers - We pride ourselves on working with an experienced and respected developer. Our smart contract will be of the highest standard, reflecting our commitment to collaborating with the best.\n\n Bot Protection - We're dedicated to ensuring that our token sale remains unaffected by bots. We will implement various strategies to minimize their ability to interfere with our project's success and token performance.\n\n FAQ - When will the airdrop take place after the NFT minting? Will it be immediately after or during the year?\n\nThe anticipated airdrop for NFT holders is scheduled to take place a few days after the Reveal day.\n\nHow many tokens will we get per airdrop?\n\nAs part of the TGE, every NFT holder will receive an airdrop of 1.67 million tokens, followed by subsequent monthly airdrops of the same amount for the subsequent two months.\n\nWill the tokens be tradable on Uniswap?\n\nUniswap will be available on TGE, and we will list it on the best CEX we have in our collaborations list.\n\nWill the NFTs be airdropped directly to my wallet, or do I need to mint them? Is there an additional cost for minting them?\n\nYou need to mint them, but our contract creators have tweaked the ERC721A so that even if you mint 40 NFTs, the cost will be minimal.\n\nWhat is the total token supply, and how many will be reserved for the NFT drop?\n\nThe total supply of tokens is 75 billion, with 45 billion being airdropped and 20.25B billion going to the liquidity pool immediately after the airdrop.\n\nWill staking be affected by Rarity?\n\nYes, we have four tiers of NFTs: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. If you are lucky enough to hold one Legendary NFT, you will receive a 5x boost on your staking.\nThe staking multipliers for each NFT tier are as follows:\nCommon - 1x\nRare - 1.25x\nEpic - 2x\nLegendary - 5x\nThe drop rates for each NFT tier are: Common - 70%, Rare - 20%, Epic - 9%, and Legendary - 1%.\n\nWhat is the staking period, and will there be penalties for early withdrawals?\n\nYou can withdraw your stake at any time, but there will be a cooldown period of 3 days.\n\nWhat are the use cases for the token, and how will it be used within the ecosystem?\n\nThe ecosystem is based on the correlation between the NFTs and the token. We will have daily staking pool rewards, which are not inflationary since the tokens come from the daily tax. Additionally, we have much more in mind, everything will be presented once it ready.\n\nIs there a vesting period for team tokens or any other reserved tokens, and if so, what is the duration?\n\nThe team will receive their tokens over a period of 3 months, just like everyone else. There are currently 15 members on the team, and the tokens will be divided equally among them.\n\nWhat are the plans for community governance, and will token holders have any say in future development or decision-making for the project?\n\nWe have Plans to Build a DAO for the Holders.\n\nIf you have any questions about our project, including tokenomics or other aspects, please feel free to ask in our community chat group.\n\n"

Our services, including Account Abstraction (AA), Assets Bridge (AB), Access Control (AC) and much more.\n\n Account Abstraction (AA) - The Friendliest Wallet to Manage Your Crypto. Secured by Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Technology, you can forget the convoluted details. Your crypto is now finally recoverable and non-custodial.\n\n Assets Bridge (AB) - The Most Private Way to Send & Receive Crypto. Leveraging Ruby Connect, you have the full assurance that your transaction data is not only safe but invisible. Just crypto away.\n\n Access Control (AC) - Join The Force And Rebuild It With Us. Ruby SDK empowers every developer in the world to easily enforce privacy and access-control in product design. It is lite, easy, and programmable.\n\n On-chain Private Payment - The solution can shield sensitive transaction information from prying eyes. It will customize the keys to reveal the transaction details you want to see, such as addresses, input, output, or identity.\n\n Asset Management and Custody - The combination of Ruby Auth and Ruby Wallet allows users to manage their assets with ease while also enjoying guaranteed privacy and security. Cryptographic signatures must be used to authorize access to assets and each action taken.\n\n Off-chain Data Management - Using Ruby's solutions, users can easily store and encrypt any off-chain data, such as a word document or your seed phrase. Normally, users must store the content and metadata on a centralized server, but Ruby will only store it and enforce access control for whoever can decrypt it.\n\n ZK Proof of KYC and Authentication - It focuses on performing KYC without leaking private identity information. The functional encryption will be employed to guarantee that only controlled KYC information is revealed to the entity users are trying to authenticate to. It will ensure user data and identity confidentiality while performing the KYC steps.\n\n NFT-gated or DID-gated Access - The trend shows that future access to various digital or physical experiences is likely to be gated by NFT or DID. Functional encryption serves as a natural mechanism to enforce any access-control policy defined on either NFT or DID. Combined with smart-contract-based access control, it has the power to fundamentally redefine fine-grained access as a utility for both NFT and DID.\n\n Privacy-preserving Cloud Computing - Protecting users\u2019 data privacy when the users upload their encrypted private data to the cloud. Through privacy-preserving machine learning and labeling based on functional encryption, the Web 2.0 cloud computing business model via selling users\u2019 privacy will be revolutionized.\n\n"

Streamr technology is a core service layer which implements a vendor-neutral, real-time publish/subscribe protocol for data transmission. The data travels via a global peer-to-peer network, which is scalable, robust and permissionless.\n\nThe technology works in tandem with companion blockchains - currently Ethereum, Gnosis, and Polygon - which are used for identity, security, and payments.\n\nAs our connected world creates and consumes more and more data, it has not been possible to connect the billions of devices worldwide with real-time data via a decentralised network. Meanwhile, today's existing centralised services are subject to a single point of failure and vendor lock in.\n\nStreamr solves these problems by delivering a low latency and secure decentralised broadcast messaging protocol - via a peer to peer (P2P) network architecture. Thanks to this P2P architecture - the network is fault tolerant, resilient to malicious attacks and scales in line with the growth of the network - for scalable many to many real time data pipelines.\n\nThe Streamr project was started in 2017 by Henri Pihkala, Nikke Nylund, Risto Karjalainen and Michael Malka.\n\nStreamr is a distributed open-source software project with around 30 key contributors around the world, including both companies and individuals.\n\nWe publish updates about Streamr, the ecosystem, node running, and other happenings from the project on the Streamr blog, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Telegram (announcements only), and Discord community.\n\nThe complete DATA tokenomics will be in released at the \"Streamr 1.0\" milestone. Streamr node operators will secure and relay data on streams associated to Sponsorships. Delegators delegate to Operators and earn a revenue share of the Operator's work in return.\n\n"

Zoom Ahead in the Digital Race where Speed is the Crown Jewel of the Modern Age!\n\n Unleash Your Creativity: Landslide Blockchain - Where Developers Thrive! - All of your chains in one place. Develop decentralized applications and perform fast transaction execution using the Landslide platform. Additionally, you have the ability to seamlessly import Solidity-based Dapps, as Landslide offers compatibility with the Solidity programming language. Landslide seamlessly integrates with two other chains, including Avalanche and Solana, with a roadmap promising more to come.\n\n Powering the Web3 and DeFi Revolution with Blazing Blockchain Speed - Blazing speed matters. In the dynamic realm of DeFi, metaverse, and web3, the pulse of progress quickens with every transaction. A bygone era of mere 7 transactions per second now yields to a horizon where speed reigns supreme. As the decentralized finance and metaverse communities flourish, celerity emerges as the ultimate imperative. \"Defi demands turbocharged speed and boundless scalability.\"\n\n A true scalable solution - Landslide Protocol is a highly scalable blockchain platform embedding smart contracts which prioritizes rapid transaction speed, cost efficiency, and eco-consciousness. Our overarching aim is to build an immensely scalable blockchain, upholding decentralization and security without compromise.\n\n What do they say? - Highly Scalable and Blazing speed. The very idea of a blockchain operating at such blazing speed seemed almost surreal, and it completely shifted my perspective. I found myself reflecting on how far we've come since the early days of blockchain technology. Back then, discussions often revolved around transaction bottlenecks and scalability challenges. Yet here was this groundbreaking example, redefining what we thought was possible. The surprise didn't just stem from the numbers; it was the realization that innovation can disrupt even our most firmly held beliefs. This blockchain wasn't just scalable; it was pushing the boundaries of scalability to heights we couldn't have imagined.\n\n Pushing the boundaries! - I recently had the opportunity to dive into the world of Landslide technology and explore the capabilities of the Landslide blockchain. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. Landslide's speed and scalability are truly remarkable, setting it apart from many other blockchain solutions on the market. First and foremost, the speed at which Landslide processes transactions is truly noteworthy. Transactions are confirmed and added to the blockchain in a matter of seconds, providing a seamless and efficient experience for users. This rapid transaction processing opens up a plethora of possibilities for real-time applications, making it suitable for industries that require instant verification and settlement. What truly sets Landslide apart, however, is its impressive scalability. The blockchain seamlessly handles an increasing number of transactions without compromising its performance. This scalability is a game-changer, especially in a world where traditional blockchains often struggle to maintain their efficiency as user numbers grow.\n\n What are you waiting for? - X (Twitter)\n\nTelegram\n\nDon't miss out!

You can swap it back at any time. Use MyShare to reduce your staking fees. Additionally, you can stake your MyShare tokens for rewards by using them to create NFTs. Profit from our staking pools which include tokens ranging from stable coins like BUSD to meme coins like PEPE. By creating your own NFT with MyShare, you are staking the MyShare tokens. Then, you can trade with the NFT or burn it for rewards.\n\n How can I buy MyShare? - You can buy MyShare tokens on PancakeSwap by clicking on the button at the top of this page or here.\n\n What is a MY Token? - MY tokens are wrapped versions of regular ERC-20 tokens. They combine yield farming with rebase tokens, accumulating yields through positive rebases, rewarding holders of the underlying token.\n\n If I buy myBUSD with BUSD, can I get the BUSD back? - Yes, as myBUSD is pegged to BUSD.

Being permissionless means that anyone can freely access and participate in our platform without needing approval or authorization from a central entity.\n\n BSGG - Betswap is the decentralized sports betting exchange and casino built with blockchain technology, where players can opt to play casino games or make peer to peer sports betting on their favorite teams.\n\n Betting exchange - A betting exchange is a marketplace that allows bettors to wager against each other at lower fees than those offered by a traditional sportsbook. Two customers agree on the odds and stakes for a given game, and bet against one another. Betting exchanges are different from traditional betting sites in that they allow players to bet directly against each other and set odds themselves. Instead of being limited to the odds set by bookies, and only having the option to back a certain outcome, a betting exchange allows users to go head-to-head against each other by either backing or laying.\n\n Ethereum Smart Contracts - Ethereum smart contracts are written in computer code and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, and are essentially self-executing contracts with predetermined rules and conditions. They enable transaction and agreement automation without the use of intermediaries. Consider a smart contract to be a digital contract between two or more parties. These contracts specify the terms and circumstances that apply to a certain transaction or relationship. When the contract's requirements are met, the contract automatically executes itself, carrying out the agreed-upon acts. Most of the betting process at Betswap uses smart contracts. When you opt to sign in via web3, we never take possession of your funds, ever.\n\n Advantage of using blockchain technology - There are various advantages to using blockchain technology in a betting site. To begin, blockchain enables transparency and immutability, which means that all transactions on the blockchain are available to all participants and cannot be edited or manipulated. Furthermore, blockchain-based betting sites can deliver transactions that are quicker and more efficient. Withdrawals can be implemented fast with automated smart contracts, eliminating the need for manual processing. Finally, the adoption of blockchain improves security. It becomes very resistant to hacking or data manipulation by storing data across a decentralized network of computers. This protects both user payments and personal information.\n\n"

However, we\u2019ve rarely experienced what it would be like to choose the best starter pokemon of them all, Pikachu. Well, now you finally have the chance to explore just that in our very own multiplayer PikaGame.\n\nThis story-based game will be centered around Pikachu as we dive deep into his origins and his upbringing and learn about his early life from the very beginning.

Pika Inu will feature in the game as a character that is derived from the PikaNFT\u2019s.\n\nThe multiplayer mode of the PikaVerse is a Play-To-Earn NFT-Based game.\nPlayers must purchase a PikaNFT character and use this character in the multiplayer game. Play-To-Earn minigames within the PikaVerse will allow holders to increase their in-game holding amount which in turn can be converted to $PIKACHU.\n\nThe PikaVerse will incorporate many avenues such as Player Vs Player, whereby players can use their PikaInu to verse other Players\u2019 PikaInu\u2019s. The attributes are based on the rarity of the NFT\u2019s which are defined in the Metadata of each NFT.\n\nOther features to the game include Player Vs Environment and Raids \u2013 players can band together to take down the NPC\u2019s that raid the island that the PikaVerse is set on. Earn points as you deal more damage in these raids.\nBuckle in though, these raids can last for hours and even days! Trade your PikaPoints for traits or for your PikaInu NFT making it more powerful and rare.\n\nThe PikaNFT platform will allow users to check the strength level of their PikaInu with different traits bringing different powers. With a limited amount of PikaNFT\u2019s, PikaInu\u2019s will become scarce which is when the in-game trading and on market begins.\n\n PikaMap - \n\n How To Buy - Register on Binance and get $100\n\nWin up to $10,000 in 2 steps\n\nRegister and receive your 5,030 USDT now!\n\nGet $5 to Receive Alerts\n\n"

Deploy dApps on multiple blockchains as if they were one.\n\n We're bringing blockchain together - Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is spread across multiple different blockchains and systems. Athreum is unifying blockchains, closing the gaps between solutions and integrating new technical advancements to the space. In short: it\u2019s a secure, fast, reliable, connected solution to the biggest issues facing blockchain today. And it all runs on Athreum Inchain architecture.\n\n Governance - The Validator Swarm is the governance structure powering Athreum and is comprised of a diverse group of industry-leading organizations.\n\n Parallel execution of smart contracts - Athreum stands to be the blockchain technology to enable mainstream adoption. Our computation model scales horizontally, reducing bottlenecks in smart contract code execution.\n\n Uniform deployment across all blockchains - Athreum uses the WebAssembly runtime environment, which allows programmers to continue using a programming language and toolchain they\u2019re already familiar with.\n\n Unique strong coupling of blockchains - Athreum approach allows a high degree of interoperability, enabling applications to utilize properties, functionality, and information from multiple chains \u2014 with fewer tradeoffs.\n\n Security - Athreum uses industry-leading network validators to help secure the protocol and has passed rigorous security audits (round 1, round 2). Regular, in-depth network reviews ensure that Athreum maintains the highest levels of security.\n\n Reactive smart contracts - Athreum allows multichain dApps to respond to events on the underlying chains and react to any other smart contract\u2019s data in real time.\n\n Secure indexing of blockchain data - Athreum ensures easy, cryptographically-secure merging of information between blockchains, allowing dApps to use the merged information in smart contracts without compromising security.\n\n Cross-chain token issuance - Keep transactions (and actions) fast, secure, and liquid without additional steps or repeat movements across multiple blockchains.\n\n Cross-chain DeFi protocols - With the ability to create true cross-chain dApps, Coinweb solves DeFi\u2019s persistent problems and opens new and more advanced DeFi protocols.\n\n High performance, adaptive dApps - No matter how slow individual blockchains update, Athreum allows dApps to easily move between chains to maintain optimal functionality.\n\n High performance, low fee dApps - dApps continue to become more complex, which means higher operational fees. The demand for low cost, high performance decentralized computation is increasing.\n\n Secure interoperability - Athreum causal consistency model secures the protocol against instabilities in connected chains, while still maintaining full usability at the application level.\n\n High capacity smart contracts - dApp platforms tie the performance of dApps to how often dApps are used, causing bottlenecks and increasing the risk of higher costs. In Coinweb, every transaction runs in parallel, even if triggered by the same smart-contract.\n\n The Athreum digital wallet - A simple, intuitive digital wallet for everyone.

            "summary": "Welcome to Firmseed - The Future of Real Estate Investing! - At Firmseed, we are on a mission to revolutionize the way people invest in real estate. We believe that everyone should have access to high-quality real estate investments, regardless of their location or income level. That\u2019s why we have created a fractional real estate investment platform that utilizes the power of blockchain and DeFi to make real estate transparent, borderless, and hassle-free.\n\n Our vision - Our vision is to revolutionize the real estate investment industry by using blockchain and DeFi to make real estate investments more transparent, borderless, and accessible to everyone.\n\n Our mission - Our mission is to democratize real estate investing by providing investors with access to high-quality real estate assets through fractional ownership. We believe that by leveraging the power of blockchain and DeFi, we can create a more efficient and secure investment process that benefits both investors and property owners.\n\n Tokenomics - Token Name: Firmseed\nToken Symbol: FIRM\nTotal Supply: 50,000,000\nChain: BSC/ETH\nInitial Market Cap: $25,000\nListing Price: $0.005\n\n What is Firmseed? - Firmseed is a digital platform that enables investors gain exposure to high-quality real estate assets through fractional ownership. With Firmseed, everyone can invest in a variety of properties, including residential and commercial buildings. It\u2019s much better than buying property yourself because it\u2019s all done online and the experience is simple, transparent and hassle free.\n\n How does Firmseed work? - Firmseed uses blockchain to facilitate the fractional ownership of real estate assets. Our platform allows multiple individuals to pool their resources together to purchase a property, with each individual owning a fraction of the asset. Investors can then earn rental income and potentially benefit from any capital appreciation of the property.\n\n What are the advantages of investing with Firmseed? - Investing with Firmseed offers several advantages, including: Diversification, Liquidity, Transparency, and Access.\n\n How do I invest with Firmseed? - To invest with Firmseed, you first need to sign up for an account on the app. Once you\u2019ve created an account, you can browse the properties available for investment and select the ones you\u2019re interested in. You can then invest in these properties using cryptocurrencies or fiat.\n\n What kind of due diligence does Firmseed conduct on properties? - Our team conducts thorough due diligence on each property before it is listed on our platform. This includes an assessment of the property\u2019s location, quality, potential returns, and any legal or regulatory requirements. We also work with experienced property managers to ensure that the property is well-maintained and generating rental income.\n\n What are the fees associated with investing with Firmseed? - Firmseed charges a management fee for each property, which covers the costs associated with managing and maintaining the property. This fee is typically a percentage of the rental income earned from the property.\n\n How is my investment secured on Firmseed? - Investments made on Firmseed are secured using blockchain, which ensures that all transactions are secure and transparent. Additionally, our team conducts thorough due diligence on each property to ensure that it meets our strict criteria for quality and potential returns.\n\n What is the minimum investment amount on Firmseed? - The minimum investment amount on Firmseed varies depending on the property. However, we aim to make our investments accessible to a wide range of investors, so the minimum investment amount is typically as low as $10.\n\n What kind of returns can I expect from investing with Firmseed? - Returns on investments made through Firmseed will depend on several factors, including the type of property, its location, and the prevailing market conditions. However, our team carefully selects each property to ensure that it has the potential to generate strong returns.\n\n What am I investing in? - When you invest in a property on Firmseed, you are investing in the shares of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that will own the title deed to the subject property. All investors in a property will be issued shares in the SPV in proportion to the amount they invested.\n\n Can I visit the property I invested in? - No. As part of our commitment to being fully transparent with our investor base, all properties offered on the Firmseed will include a full 3D walkthrough, high resolution photos and inspection reports. However as we generally look to offer properties that are already tenanted, visiting those units can be difficult and impractical, especially with many investors in each property. It is therefore not operationally feasible to arrange visits to all properties.\n\n What are Firmseed's services? - Firmseed is in charge of operating the platform as well as identifying and managing investments on behalf of investors until the end of their Investment Term (i.e. until a property has been sold and capital returned back to investors). This includes ensuring that all digital and other operations are running smoothly and in compliance with regulations, that assets are being identified and evaluated appropriately, and that investments are being executed and managed responsibly. In addition to financial administration, we eliminate all operational headaches for our investors as they do not have to worry about tenant operations, leasing, maintenance or any technical requirements.\n\n How do I view detailed information regarding investments on Firmseed? - It\u2019s simple and free. You can register on the app and create an account within a couple of minutes. After you have registered, you can go through all available investment opportunities and get full access to the details on each, including but not limited to the property\u2019s floor plan, a Firmseed investment memorandum, a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) produced by a trusted third party data provider, Financial Projections and walk-through images of the properties.\n\n"

DFL brings the financial sophistication of AI-managed funds to DeFi. DFL AI yield aggregator, dynamically manages portfolios, performs efficient asset allocation, recommends and invests them in various high-yield liquidity pools as well as in financial trading based on quantitative algorithms to maximize the returns.\n\n What is DeFi? - Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies. DeFi eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge for using their services. Individuals hold money in a secure digital wallet, can transfer funds in minutes, and anyone with an internet connection can use DeFi. DeFi offers transparency. As it functions on blockchain technology, all transactions, data, and codes on the blockchain are transparent to everyone, thereby providing better scope for audits and security.\n\n What is DeFi Staking? - DeFi staking is a process where crypto assets get locked in a smart contract. What investors get through this is rewards that often work as a passive income. Generally, the crypto assets which investors stake are non-fungible and fungible tokens while their rewards are interest that they earn by staking them. In the traditional system, rewards are distributed according to the computing power of the computer, while in the staking process, rewards are distributed according to the amount of crypto assets held. In recent years, staking has become a mainstream in the world due to concerns that traditional systems place a high burden on computers and use too much energy, which will negatively affect the global environment.\n\n DFL - DFL deploy an ecosystem of Artificial Intelligence to support trading decisions on DFL which will help increase the value and returns of the users by providing liquidity to DeFi markets. AI Yield Aggregator developed independently by DFL, manage portfolio dynamically, allocate asset efficiently, invest in various high-yield liquidity pools, invest in financial trading by Artificial Intelligence based on quantum trading algorithm, are automatically performed. This has resulted in unprecedentedly high APR.\n\n Security Auditor - A blockchain security audit is a secure technology that supports high-value transactions taking place on a blockchain. Security audits are particularly valuable for DeFi projects to protect blockchain transactions worth millions of dollars or a huge amount of investors. DFL has been audited by globally recognized auditors, CertiK and Cyberscope.\n\n"

            "summary": "The Role Of Trading Bots That Make The Life Easier For Crypto Fanatics A Lot Easier - Cryptocurrencies are known to be highly volatile and their prices fluctuate dramatically in a fraction of seconds. Cryptocurrencies are now accepted against buying many products. Crypto enthusiasts can now buy Rolex with BTC, which is a revolution in the crypto industry. Many organizations and companies have started accepting cryptocurrencies. Crypto trading allows investors to trade from anywhere at any time. However, these factors restrict human trading in several ways. The main issue is that it is difficult for humans to respond to the instantly changing prices in the market to find the optimal trades. The slowdowns that happen in the transaction times and exchanges make the situation worse.\n\nIt is difficult for most investors to find time for crypto trading to achieve the best trades. To get the best results, traders have to dedicate themselves 24\u00d77 to finding the trends and changes happening in the crypto markets.\n\nLuckily, investors can find solutions for these issues easily. Automated tools or trading bots are the best solutions for these problems.\n\nCrypto trading happens 24\u00d77 and bots help traders to make the best use of the fluctuations in the crypto market. They are much faster than humans and therefore, instantly react to the changes in the market. Trading bots can assist in analyzing market data and identifying potential trading opportunities, including cryptocurrencies that may experience the rise in price. Blogs such as welke crypto gaat stijgen vandaag also provide valuable insights into cryptocurrencies that are likely to experience a surge. Bots also help those investors who cannot spend more time studying the crypto market to find the best trades. Arbitrage bot is one of the popular trading bots that make maximum use of the price difference in various exchanges.\n\nWhat are the different types of bots?\n\nCrypto bots are of different types. As mentioned above, the arbitrage bot is one of the most popular crypto bots in the market. They can analyze the price variations across multiple exchanges and place trades to make use of the variations. As common cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can have different prices on different exchanges, Bots are quicker and they can beat the exchanges that fail to update the prices on time. Other crypto bots utilize the historical price data to evaluate trading strategies, which will give the traders an upper hand. There are many specialized bots too that are particularly programmed to implement traders at specific signals like trading volume or price.\n\nHow do bots work?\n\nThere are several free bot applications and programs to help traders in crypto trading. However, some other bots charge a certain fee for their services and a good number of these are on the expensive side. Most investors look for bots that are best suited for them and they download the code of the bot from a developer. The software and hardware requirements of each bot will be different.\n\nBots can be very helpful even though many people argue that crypto bots should not be admitted into trading. To effectively use the features of the crypto bot, the investor must know how to use the tool in the best way. For example, they must have accounts on multiple exchanges to take the advantage of using bots. These accounts must have crypto assets. In several cases, the investor will have to decide on when to buy or sell their assets. If you wish to make profits from crypto investment, you must be ready to invest some time and effort too for trading.\n\n"

            "summary": "Secure Vehicle Communication with Blockchain - The number of vehicles moving on the roads increased dramatically since years. With the addition of smart and autonomous vehicles, road traffic and data management has been one of the most challenging topics on the roads... Vehicles have wireless communication capabilities, GPS communication interfaces. By the way of the interfaces, vehicles are turning into smart devices with data processing connectivity features. With a connected vehicular network, traffic management, data exchange, and entertainment applications will be available between the vehicles. VANET(Vehicle AdHoc Network) is the name of this vehicle network. In VANET, Vehicles can communicate with each other V2V(Vehicle to Vehicle) and with other units V2I(Vehicle to Infrastructure). Vehicle communication brings advantages like traffic management, data exchange, road safety, prevention of accidents, however security of VANET has become an issue. Malicious vehicles can steal data, send untrusted data and can cause the network to fail and make the vehicle communication abused. This may cause accidents, traffic system failures and becomes a threat for people. For security reasons, blockchain technology can become a solution to cope with security problems on VANET. Blockchain technology solves the problems that VANETs face and provide protection for security of the vehicle network. In the VANETC project, we will create a custom blockchain VanetChain that is customized for VANET security. VANETC is the token on BSC network.\n\n Secure Vehicle Communication with Blockchain - In order to solve the critical message security problems on VANET, a new type of blockchain VANETCHAIN will be implemented. Because of untrusted information sent by malicious vehicles, true data can not be processed accurately in VANET... The blockchain will provide event message transmission and exchange between vehicles. A local blockchain for a region for vehicle intercommunication can be used. POW consensus mechanism is used to handle the event message processing of the chain. The event messages in the vehicle network act as transactions in the bitcoin network. We try to handle vehicle node and message trustworthiness by the way of the VANET blockchain.\n\n Vehicular Communication Technology - Vehicular technology plays a critical role by sharing critical event information. ... In vehicular ad hoc networks V2V(Vehicle to Vehicle), V2I(Vehicle to Infrastructure),V2X(Vehicle to Everything) communication types are supported. For the vehicle to infrastructure type, vehicles are communicated with RSU(Road Side Units.) RSUs play an important role to route the messages to other vehicles. Vehicles communicate with other vehicles and RSUs with the help of OBUs(On Board Units). OBUs have dedicated wireless technology hardwares for connecting to the wireless networks that the Chain takes place. Wifi, Lora can be used for test scenarios, but for advanced VANET applications, cellular technology can be used such as 5g. With the help of 5g technology, event message transmission will be arranged and sent fast and with minimal latency. Accident information, road information and condition(frozen), weather information, traffic reports can be sent with low latency at the edge.\n\n"
