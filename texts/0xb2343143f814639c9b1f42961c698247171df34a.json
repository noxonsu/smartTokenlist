    "proposal": "Hey there CoreMultichain community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nEver thought about expanding your horizons beyond the multichain realm? We have a toolbox of B2B solutions that might tickle your fancy. It's not about playing, it's about creating. \n\nImagine, a DEX platform based on Uniswap V2, with your own colors, logo, menus, fees, token list, and a commission rate that you set. Or how about a blockchain-based lottery where you can earn 0-30% commission? And that's just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nWe also offer a customizable multicurrency crypto wallet, ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming, governance and proposals for your crypto token, an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and even a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nAnd the best part? Most of these tools are available on a revenue share basis. You don't have to pay anything upfront. \n\nSo, if you're interested in taking CoreMultichain to the next level, let's chat. You can check out our demos here: https://t.me/onoutdemos. \n\nAnd remember, we're not selling lottery tickets here, we're helping you build the lottery. \ud83d\ude09"
