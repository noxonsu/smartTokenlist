    "proposal": "Since I'm unable to access the website due to a certificate error, I'll create a generic icebreaker based on the information you've provided. \n\n\"Hello, LayerNetwork community! \ud83d\udc4b I heard through the grapevine that you folks are all about creating a more decentralized future, and boy, do we have the tools to help you do just that. \n\nNo, we're not selling lottery tickets or DEX memberships. We're offering you the chance to create your own with our DEX (UNI FACTORY) and Blockchain-based Lottery. And the best part? It won't cost you a dime, since it's all revenue share. \n\nWe also have a whole host of other B2B tools that could help LayerNetwork reach new heights. From creating a multicurrency crypto wallet to setting up an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, we've got you covered. \n\nRemember, with us, you're not playing, you're creating. Check out our demos on https://t.me/onoutdemos and let us know if you're interested. Let's build the future together, one layer at a time. \ud83d\ude09\""
