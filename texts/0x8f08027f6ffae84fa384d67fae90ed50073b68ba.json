    "proposal": "Hey Lite X Network community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like to have your own DEX or Lottery? Or maybe you've dreamed about creating a multicurrency crypto wallet? Well, with our B2B tools, you can turn those dreams into reality. \n\nWe've got everything from DEX (UNI FACTORY), Lottery, Wallet, Farming, DAO, CrossChain, to IDOFactory - Launchpad. And the best part? It's all at a price of $0 - revenue share for DEX and Lottery. That's right, you don't have to pay a dime unless you make a profit. \n\nImagine the possibilities! You could have a DEX with your own LTX token, a lottery that supports ETH, BSC, and Polygon, and even a wallet that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and your own tokens. \n\nAnd if you're all about sustainability (like we know Lite X Network is), you'll love our energy-efficient consensus mechanisms. It's like having your own green blockchain ecosystem. \n\nSo, what do you say? Are you ready to take the leap and create your own blockchain tools? If yes, then hop over to https://t.me/onoutdemos and let's get started. \n\nRemember, it's not about playing the game, it's about creating it. So let's create something amazing together! \ud83d\udc4b"
