    "proposal": "Hello @MinarArena community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nWe heard you're the best seller of the month with some pretty cool ideas for an NFT Wallet! We're big fans of innovation here, and we think we might have some B2B tools that could align perfectly with your vision. \n\nNow, we're not here to sell you a lottery ticket or a DEX, but to offer you the tools to create your own! Imagine, a DEX or a Lottery, fully customized to your brand, with the power to attract and engage your community. \n\nWe also offer tools to create a multicurrency crypto wallet, staking & yield farming, DAO, blockchain bridge, and even a launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. All fully customizable and designed to support the growth of communities like yours. \n\nAnd the best part? It's not a game you're playing, but a game you're creating. \n\nCheck out our B2B tools here: https://t.me/onoutdemos. \n\nLet us know if you're interested, and we can mine some ideas together! \ud83e\ude99\n\nP.S. If Elvis is still in the building, we'd love to hear his thoughts on this! \ud83d\ude09"
