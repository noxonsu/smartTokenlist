    "proposal": "Hello folks of Buy White List! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nEver wondered what it feels like to walk into a candy shop, only to realize the candies are actually a suite of B2B tools? Well, that's us, and we're here to sweeten your project journey. \n\nWe can't help you buy a white list, but we can certainly help you create one! With our tools, you can not only create your own DEX and Lottery, but also a multicurrency crypto wallet, a staking & yield farming platform, a DAO, a blockchain bridge, and even a launchpad for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nAnd the best part? The price tags on these tools are as attractive as the profits you're promising your white list buyers. From zero cost revenue-sharing options to affordable one-time payments, we've got you covered. \n\nRemember, we're not here to play the game, we're here to help you create it. So, if you're interested in adding some more tools to your project toolbox, let's chat! \n\nCheck out our demo and offerings here: https://t.me/onoutdemos \n\nPS: Payment in candies not accepted...yet! \ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf6c\ud83c\udf6d"
