    "proposal": "Hello Antofy Enthusiasts! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI see you're all staking $ABN like there's no tomorrow, and why wouldn't you with a whopping 160% APY! That's some serious number crunching right there. \ud83e\uddee\n\nBut have you ever wondered what it would be like to create your own DEX or run a blockchain-based lottery? Well, we're here to tell you that it's not just for the big shots anymore. \n\nOur B2B tools are designed to help communities like yours grow and thrive. We offer a range of services from creating a DEX based on Uniswap V2 (commission ranging from 0.00% to 20%) to setting up a blockchain-based lottery (earn 0-30% commission). \n\nAnd the best part? These tools are revenue share tools, meaning anyone from the community can deploy them. It's like owning your own shop of B2B tools, but without the overheads. \ud83d\udee0\n\nWe also offer other services like creating a multicurrency crypto wallet, setting up ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming, governance and proposals for your crypto token, creating an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. All customizable to align with your vision and tokenomics. \n\nSo, why not take a break from staking and check out what else we have to offer? Visit us at https://t.me/onoutdemos. \n\nRemember, you're not just playing, you're creating. Let's make the Antofy community even stronger! \ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udcaa\n\nP.S. We promise our smart contracts are just as readable as yours. \ud83d\ude09"
