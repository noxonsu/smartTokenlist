    "proposal": "Hello AVEDEX community! \ud83d\udc4b \n\nI hope you're all having a great day. I've been looking into your project and I must say, it's quite impressive. The vision you guys have is something we can align with. Now, I'm not here to sell you lottery tickets or ask you to swap tokens on a DEX, but rather to offer you the tools to create your own. \n\nHere at our B2B shop, we offer a range of tools that can help you grow your community and increase your revenue. From creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2 to setting up a blockchain-based lottery, we've got you covered. And the best part? You don't have to pay anything upfront. We operate on a revenue share basis.\n\nWe also offer tools to create a multicurrency crypto wallet, ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming, and even a governance and proposal system for your AVEDEX token. \n\nAnd if you're looking to expand your horizons, we have tools to create an EVM compatible blockchain bridge and a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nI promise, no technical jargon, no complex procedures. Just simple, effective tools that you can customize to suit your needs. \n\nSo, are you ready to take AVEDEX to the next level? Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. \n\nCheck out our demos here: https://t.me/onoutdemos \ud83d\ude4c\n\nRemember, you're not just playing the game, you're creating it."
