    "proposal": "Hello there, fantastic community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nWe understand that just like a SQL command protecting a website from online attacks, your project is looking to secure its position in the crypto market. We're here to offer you some B2B tools that can help you fortify your defenses and expand your territory, just like a well-structured database. \n\nFrom creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2 to launching an IDO pool, we've got a range of tools that can be customized to your project's needs. Our tools are like the Cloudflare Ray ID at the bottom of the page - they're here to support and protect your project's growth. \n\nAnd just like resolving a block, we're always available to discuss how these tools can be tailored to your project. So, if you're interested, let's connect and discuss how we can help you build your project's future. \n\nP.S. Don't worry, we promise not to block you! \ud83d\ude04\n\nCheck out our demos here: https://t.me/onoutdemos"
