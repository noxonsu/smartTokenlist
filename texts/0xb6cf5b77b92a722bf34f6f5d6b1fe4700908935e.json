    "proposal": "Hello Axioma community! \ud83d\udc4b \n\nI'm sure you're all excited about the potential of an eco-friendly property portfolio that rewards in USDT. The Axioma token is a game-changer, isn't it? But have you ever thought about the possibility of making it even more dynamic and accessible? \n\nHow about creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2? You could set your own commission from 0.00% to 20%. And the best part? It's absolutely free, with revenue share options. \n\nOr, let's imagine a blockchain-based lottery where you can earn 0-30% commission. It supports ETH, BSC, Polygon, and of course, the Axioma token. \n\nBut wait, there's more! Ever thought about having your own multicurrency crypto wallet? Or creating an ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming? Or even setting up a governance and proposals system for Axioma token? \n\nAnd let's not forget about the possibility of creating an EVM compatible blockchain bridge or a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"This sounds great, but I'm not a developer!\" Well, that's the beauty of it. These are all B2B tools. You're not playing, you're creating. \n\nIf you're interested in taking Axioma to the next level, check out the demos at https://t.me/onoutdemos. Let's make Axioma not just the world's first DAO property ecosystem, but also the most innovative one! \ud83d\udc4d \n\nP.S. Remember, the UK has to reach net-zero carbon goals by 2050. So, let's get a move on! \ud83d\ude09\n"
