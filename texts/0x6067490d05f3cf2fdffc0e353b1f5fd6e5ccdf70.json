    "proposal": "Hello there, MMPro community! \n\nEver wondered what it would be like if you had the power to create your own DEX or Lottery? Or perhaps a custom crypto wallet? Well, consider us your Aladdin's lamp. \n\nWe offer a wide range of B2B tools designed to support the growth of communities like yours. And the best part? Most of them are available at a revenue share basis, meaning you don't have to pay upfront. \n\nFor instance, you can create your own DEX based on Uniswap V2, with the ability to customize colors, logo, menus, fees, and tokenlist. Or perhaps you're interested in a blockchain-based lottery where you can earn 0-30% commission. \n\nAnd let's not forget about the MMPro Token. With our tools, you can create ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming, attract investments by offering rewards, and use any ERC20 tokens, including Uniswap lp. \n\nBut that's not all. We also provide tools to create a multicurrency crypto wallet, governance and proposals for your crypto token, an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nSo, are you ready to stop playing and start creating? Check out our demos here: https://t.me/onoutdemos \n\nRemember, we're not a genie, but we can make your wishes come true. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4b"
