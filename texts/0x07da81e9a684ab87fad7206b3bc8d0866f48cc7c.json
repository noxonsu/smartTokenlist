    "proposal": "Hey there, SECONDLIVE enthusiasts! \n\nWe've been living in your metaverse for a while now, and we must say, it's quite a sight! We've been crafting our avatars, building our virtual oases, and even tried our hand at creating some metaverse wearables. We've been so inspired by your AI agents and 3D AMA cosmos that we started thinking, \"How can we contribute to this amazing project?\"\n\nWell, we've got a proposition for you. You see, we're not just metaverse tourists, we're also the proud owners of a B2B tool shop. And we think our tools might come in handy in your metaverse. \n\n\ud83d\udd04 How about a DEX for your metaverse? With our UNI FACTORY, you can create your own DEX based on Uniswap V2. \n\n\ud83c\udfb0 Or maybe a blockchain-based lottery?
