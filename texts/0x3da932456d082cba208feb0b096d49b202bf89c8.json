DEX (UNI FACTORY) - Create your own DEX based on Uniswap V2. It's like having your own DEGO swap! And the best part, it's customizable and commission-free.\n\n2. Lottery - Set up your own blockchain-based lottery. The winning numbers? That's for you to decide.\n\n3. Wallet - Build a multicurrency crypto wallet for your DEGO tokens. \n\n4. Farming - Create ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming. It's like planting your own DEGO farm and watching it grow.\n\n5. DAO - Set up governance and proposals for your DEGO token.
