    "proposal": "Hey there, DEEPSPACE Explorers! \ud83d\udc7d\n\nWe've been navigating through the crypto universe and stumbled upon your impressive mission. We couldn't help but notice how you're exploring new frontiers with your NFT starships and mining for precious resources in the vast metaverse. \n\nJust like you, we also offer tools for exploration, but ours are for the B2B space. We're like the intergalactic tool shop for crypto projects. We can't help you upgrade your NFT starships, but we can help you upgrade your project with our B2B tools. \n\nWant to set up a DEX for your DEEPSPACE tokens or create a blockchain-based lottery? How about a multicurrency crypto wallet for your explorers? Or maybe you're interested in staking and yield farming? We've got you covered. \n\nBest part? You don't have to mine any resources to pay for our services. We offer a revenue share model, so you don't have to pay anything upfront. \n\nRemember, in DEEPSPACE, no one can hear you scream, but in the B2B space, everyone can hear you succeed. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nCheck out our demo: https://t.me/onoutdemos and let us know if you're interested! Safe travels, explorers! \ud83d\ude80"
