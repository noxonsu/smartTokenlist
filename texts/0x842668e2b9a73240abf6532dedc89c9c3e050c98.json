    "proposal": "Hey there, LightDeFi community! \ud83d\udc4b \n\nJust like the speed of light, we know you're always looking for ways to move quickly and efficiently in the crypto world. We thought we'd shed some 'light' on our suite of B2B tools that can help your community grow even faster than the speed of light (pun intended \ud83d\ude09). \n\nWe're not here to sell lottery tickets or DEX spots, but to empower your community members to deploy these revenue share tools themselves. Imagine having your very own DEX, based on Uniswap V2, with your $LIGHT tokens as the star of the show! Or how about a blockchain-based lottery where you can earn 0-30% commission? Sounds illuminating, doesn't it?\n\nAnd that's not all! We also offer tools to create a multicurrency crypto wallet, ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming, governance and proposals for your crypto token, an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. All these tools are customizable to your brand, from colors and logos to assets list and banners. \n\nIt's all B2B, so you're not playing, you're creating. Let's bring more light to the DeFi space together. Interested? Check out our demos here: https://t.me/onoutdemos. \n\nRemember, we're not here to outshine you, but to help you shine brighter! \ud83d\udca1"
