    "proposal": "Greetings, Tether Community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nHave you ever thought about taking the reins and creating your own tools instead of just using them? As a fellow B2B organization, we understand the importance of having the right tools for the job. \n\nHere's a little humor to lighten the mood: Why don't we make like a blockchain and link up? \ud83d\ude04\n\nWe have a toolbox full of goodies that can help you grow your community and potentially increase your revenue. From creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2, to setting up a blockchain-based lottery, we have it all. And the best part? Most of these tools are available at $0 - revenue share, meaning you don't have to pay upfront! \n\nWe also provide options to create a multicurrency crypto wallet, ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming, governance and proposals for your crypto token, an EVM compatible blockchain bridge and a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking.\n\nAnd don't worry, we haven't forgotten about USDT. We can easily integrate your token into our system!\n\nSo, if you're interested in not just playing, but creating, we'd love to hear from you. Check us out at https://t.me/onoutdemos. We look forward to potentially partnering with you to support your community's growth."
