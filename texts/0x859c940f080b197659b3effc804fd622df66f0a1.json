    "proposal": "Hello Gemunion Community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nWe've been admiring your project's extensible, diverse, and scalable architecture and we must say, it's a gem! \ud83d\udc8e \n\nJust like you, we're also big fans of leveraging cutting-edge technologies to stay ahead in the industry. That's why we've developed a suite of B2B tools that we think could be a great match for your project. \n\nWith our tools, you can create your own DEX, launch a blockchain-based lottery, create a multicurrency crypto wallet, set up ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming, establish governance and proposals for your crypto token, create an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and even a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nAnd the best part? They're all customizable to fit your project's unique needs. Plus, some of them are available at $0 - revenue share. \n\nWe're not trying to sell you a lottery ticket here, but rather the tools to create your own. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nIf you're interested in taking a closer look, check out our demo at https://t.me/onoutdemos or drop us a line. We'd be happy to chat about how we can help Gemunion continue to shine! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\n\nRemember, with us, you're not just playing the game, you're creating it!"
