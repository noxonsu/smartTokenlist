    "proposal": "Hello Catgirl Enthusiasts! \ud83d\udc3e\n\nWe've been prowling around your project and are impressed by your vision. We believe we can help you scratch the itch of community growth with some purr-fectly tailored B2B tools. \n\n1. \ud83d\udd04 DEX (UNI FACTORY)\n   A DEX based on Uniswap V2, with your own custom colors, logo, menus, fees, and tokenlist. Best part? It's a revenue share model. You don't pay us, we just share the cream (commission: 0.00% to 20%).\n\n2. \ud83c\udfb0 Lottery\n   A blockchain-based lottery where you can earn 0-30% commission. It's like finding a stray cat and discovering it's a Bengal!\n\n3. \ud83e\ude99 Wallet\n   A multicurrency crypto wallet that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and tokens. It's like having a cozy cat bed for all your tokens.\n\n4. \ud83c\udf3e Farming\n   ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming. Attract investment by offering rewards. It's like offering catnip to your investors.\n\n5. \ud83d\uddf3 DAO\n   Governance and proposals for your crypto token. Stakeholders can create/vote for proposals without spending on gas. It's like a democratic cat council, without the hissing matches.\n\n6. \ud83c\udf09 CrossChain\n   An EVM compatible blockchain bridge. Connect all EVM blockchains like a cat jumping from one rooftop to another.\n\n7. \ud83d\ude80 IDOFactory - Launchpad\n   A launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. Use your token for IDO pools or native coins like ETH, BNB for token lockers. It's like launching a cat into space, but with less animal cruelty.\n\nRemember, you're not playing, you're creating. So let's make some magic together! Check out our demos at https://t.me/onoutdemos and let us know if you're interested. \n\nP.S. All prices are in USD, not cans of tuna (although we're open to negotiation). \ud83d\udc1f"
