    "proposal": "Hello Cognetix Community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nJust like a good cup of coffee, we understand that a great blockchain project needs the right blend of tools to bring out its unique flavor. We've been brewing up some B2B tools and we think they might just be your cup of tea (or coffee, if you prefer). \u2615\ufe0f\n\nWe've noticed your DEX supports trading across 10 different blockchain networks. That's impressive! But how about spicing things up with a little lottery action? With our Blockchain-based lottery tool, you can earn 0-30% commission. It supports ETH, BSC, Polygon, and your token, CGX. The best part? It's free to deploy. \n\nAnd speaking of CGX, we've seen your roadmap and it looks like you're planning to launch NETIX wallet multichain. We've got a multicurrency crypto wallet tool that might just make your journey easier. For $999, you can create a wallet that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens including CGX. \n\nYour project also includes staking and farming, right? Our Farming tool lets you create ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming for just $799. It's as simple as planting a seed and watching it grow. \ud83c\udf31\n\nOh, and we've got a DAO tool too. For $600, you can have governance and proposals for your CGX token. It's like a town hall meeting, but without the boring speeches. \n\nLastly, we offer a CrossChain tool. For $1500, you can create an EVM compatible blockchain bridge. It's like building bridges, but without the heavy lifting. \n\nAnd if you're thinking of launching an IDO pool, our IDOFactory - Launchpad tool is available for $950. It's like launching a rocket, but without the risk of explosion. \ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, Cognetix community, are you ready to brew up some magic with us? Check out our demo at https://t.me/onoutdemos. \n\nRemember, with us, you're not just playing, you're creating. Let's create something amazing together!"
