    "proposal": "Hello BIMACHAIN warriors! \ud83d\udc4b \n\nWe've heard tales of your super-powered adventures, fighting against evil and maintaining world order. Your advanced tech weaponry and robust security measures are indeed impressive. And we must admit, we're quite intrigued by your Amartha-inspired mainnet and its aim to bridge non-digital economic systems to blockchain-based systems. \n\nNow, we're not offering any magical weapons or divine powers, but we do have a suite of B2B tools that might just add a little extra 'oomph' to your already formidable arsenal. \n\n1. \ud83d\udd04 DEX (UNI FACTORY) - Create your own DEX based on Uniswap V2. You can customize it to your heart's content and even set your own commission rates. And the best part? The price is a revenue share, so you won't have to pay a dime upfront.\n\n2. \ud83c\udfb0 Lottery - Fancy running your own blockchain-based lottery? With our tool, you can earn up to 30% commission and have full control over the lottery's start and finish times. \n\n3. \ud83e\ude99 Wallet - Our multicurrency crypto wallet could be a great addition to your existing wallet. It supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and offers features like P2P exchange via atomic swaps and Visa/MC integration. \n\nAnd there's more! We also offer tools for Farming, DAO, CrossChain, and IDOFactory - Launchpad. \n\nWe're not suggesting you fight evil with these tools (although, who knows? Maybe they could be handy in a pinch!). But they could certainly help you create a more robust, dynamic, and engaging ecosystem for your community. \n\nSo, how about it? Ready to gear up for your next adventure? Check out our demos at https://t.me/onoutdemos and let us know if you're interested.
