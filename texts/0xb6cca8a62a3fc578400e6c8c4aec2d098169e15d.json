    "proposal": "Hello DogeStarz community! \ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udf1f\n\nEver wondered what it would be like if DogeStarz had its own DEX or maybe a Lottery? Or even better, a DogeStarz IDO launchpad? Well, guess what? We can help you make that a reality! \n\nWe offer a variety of B2B tools that can be customized to your project's needs. From creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2 to setting up a blockchain-based lottery, we've got you covered. And the best part? All these tools are available at a revenue share price, meaning you don't have to pay anything upfront!\n\nHere's a sneak peek of what we can offer:\n\n1. \ud83d\udd04 DEX (UNI FACTORY) - Imagine a DogeStarz DEX with your own colors, logo, and menus!\n2. \ud83c\udfb0 Lottery - Because who doesn't love a good lottery, especially when it's on the blockchain?\n3. \ud83e\ude99 Wallet - A multicurrency crypto wallet with DogeStarz branding, anyone?\n4. \ud83c\udf3e Farming - Let's attract more investments by offering rewards.\n5. \ud83d\uddf3 DAO - A platform for your stakeholders to create and vote for proposals.\n6. \ud83c\udf09 CrossChain - An EVM compatible blockchain bridge, because why not?\n7. \ud83d\ude80 IDOFactory - A DogeStarz Launchpad for IDO pools and token locking.\n\nRemember, it's not about playing, it's about creating. So, let's create something amazing together! Check out our demo here: https://t.me/onoutdemos. Looking forward to hearing from you soon! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nP.S. We promise no dogs were harmed in the making of these tools! \ud83d\udc36"
