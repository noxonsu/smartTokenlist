Your project has caught our attention and we believe our tools could align perfectly with your vision.\n\nWe're a shop of B2B tools, and we've got a whole kennel of them! From DEX and Lottery to Wallet, Farming, DAO, CrossChain and IDOFactory - we've got it all! And the best part? Most of them are available at $0 - revenue share. \n\nHow about creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2? Or maybe a blockchain-based lottery where you can earn 0-30% commission? You can even create a multicurrency crypto wallet or set up your own Staking & Yield Farming. \n\nAnd let's not forget about the IDOFactory - our Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nWe're all about supporting the growth of communities like yours. So, we're not here to play, we're here to help you create! \n\nCheck out our demo at https://t.me/onoutdemos. If you're interested, let's have a chat! \n\nRemember, no pressure. We're just a message away. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nP.S. We heard Huskies are good at pulling sleds, how about pulling some great B2B tools for your community? \ud83d\ude09"
