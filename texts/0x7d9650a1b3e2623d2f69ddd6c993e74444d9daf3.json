However, there are also some challenges in the RWA track, such as lack of standardization and insufficient regulation. Compared with traditional finance, the biggest difference of RWA track is that it adopts blockchain technology, which makes the tokenization and trading of assets more convenient and transparent.\n\n Lowering the threshold - The traditional financial sector sets certain thresholds due to compliance and risk prevention needs, such as the starting investment requirements for hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds, which makes it impossible for most ordinary investors to participate. RWA solves this problem through fragmentation, allowing more retail investors to participate in the investment process.\n\n Decentralized Global Asset Investment - RWA allows investors to participate in global high-quality asset investment in a decentralized way. Through RWA, more retail investors can hold U.S. bonds and obtain stable income. In addition, the pricing of high quality assets in emerging market countries is affected by the instability of local currencies, and through the RWA model combined with a decentralized stablecoin, accurate pricing of high quality assets can be achieved.\n\n Decentralized Pricing and Risk Equalization - The value of non-standard bulk products such as high-priced real estate, high-end artwork and carbon trading is difficult to price publicly because of high prices and the inability to price them uniformly and transparently. RWA's model is decentralized, allowing ordinary retail investors to participate in the investment of high-quality assets, and facilitating consensus pricing and risk sharing.\n\n Token Economics - Name: Real World Assets Symbol: RWA Total: 21 million Tax: Buy/Sell 6% Buyback: 2% Buy Now X Telegram 2% Buyback 2% Marketing 2% Returns\n\n Join us on the RWA track - After years of development, the infrastructure of the crypto field has been able to fully support the development of RWA, which mainly includes public chain and cross-chain infrastructure, Token standards, DID technology, ZK technology, etc. Join us to enjoy the RWA track!\n\n",
