    "proposal": "Hello Escrow Community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nEver wondered what it would be like if your token ESC could have its own decentralized exchange or if you could host a lottery where your community members could win big? Or maybe you've dreamt of creating a multi-currency crypto wallet with ESC as one of the supported cryptocurrencies? \n\nWell, that's not just a dream anymore. We offer a range of B2B tools that can help you expand your project and make it more engaging for your community. \n\n1. \ud83d\udd04 DEX (UNI FACTORY)\n   - Create your own DEX based on Uniswap V2.\n   - Commission: 0.00% to 20%.\n   - Price: $0 - revenue share (you have not to pay)\n   - Editable: Colors, logo, menus, fees, tokenlist.\n\n2. \ud83c\udfb0 Lottery\n   - Blockchain-based lottery; earn 0-30% commission.\n   - Supported Blockchains: ETH, BSC, Polygon.\n   - Supported tokens: ERC20 (BEP20).\n   - Admin Controls: Start/Finish lottery, set fees.\n   - Price: $0 - revenue share (you have not to pay)\n\nAnd there's more!

Just kidding, or am I? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude09"
