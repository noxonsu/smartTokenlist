    "proposal": "Hello QBEIN Community! \ud83d\ude4c\n\nEver thought about how a toolbox could upgrade your project? Well, I'm not talking about hammers and wrenches, but a toolbox of B2B solutions that could supercharge your blockchain, web3, and AI technologies. \n\nAs QBEIN is already making waves in the DeFi, GameFi, and NFT space, why not add some extra tools to your arsenal? With our DEX, Lottery, Wallet, Farming, DAO, CrossChain, and IDOFactory, you can create new revenue streams, streamline processes, and even attract a dedicated user base. \n\nAnd the best part? It's all B2B. You're not just playing, you're creating. \n\nFor instance, our DEX allows you to build your own DEX based on Uniswap V2, with 0-20% commission. Or you could deploy our Lottery tool, a blockchain-based lottery where you can earn 0-30% commission. \n\nOn the other hand, our Wallet tool allows you to create a multicurrency crypto wallet for just $999. Not to mention our Farming tool, where for $799, you can attract investment by offering rewards. \n\nWe also offer DAO, CrossChain, and IDOFactory tools, all customizable to fit your needs and goals. \n\nSo, if you're as excited about these tools as we are about your project, let's chat! We're here to support your growth, just like you've been supporting the blockchain community. \n\nCheck out our tools here: https://t.me/onoutdemos.
