    "summary": "Smart Contract Weakness Classification (SWC) - The following table contains an overview of the SWC registry. Each row consists of an SWC identifier (ID), weakness title, CWE parent and list of related code samples.\n\n",
    "proposal": "Hello, SWC Enthusiasts! \ud83d\udc4b \n\nEver wondered how to turn your smart contract weakness classifications into a strength? Or perhaps you're pondering how to turn those CWE parents into proud grandparents? Well, we've got some tools that might just tickle your fancy. \n\nHere at Our B2B Shop, we're all about empowering communities like yours. We've got a whole suite of tools that can help you expand your project, and best of all, they're as easy to deploy as it is to spot a reentrancy weakness in a smart contract. \n\nFrom creating your very own DEX based on Uniswap V2 \ud83d\udd04, to setting up a blockchain-based lottery \ud83c\udfb0, we've got you covered. Fancy a multicurrency crypto wallet \ud83e\ude99? We can do that. How about some staking and yield farming? \ud83c\udf3e We've got a tool for that too. \n\nAnd let's not forget about governance and proposals for your crypto token \ud83d\uddf3, or perhaps an EVM compatible blockchain bridge \ud83c\udf09. And for those of you looking to launch your own IDO pools and token locking, we've got an IDOFactory - Launchpad \ud83d\ude80 ready to go!\n\nSo, whether you're an SWC-100 (Function Default Visibility) or an SWC-104 (Unchecked Call Return Value), we've got something for everyone. \n\nRemember, it's all B2B, so you're not playing, you're creating. Let's turn those weaknesses into strengths, together! \n\nCheck out our demo at https://t.me/onoutdemos. Let me know if you're interested! \n\nP.S. We promise our tools are more reliable than a solidity compiler on a good day. \ud83d\ude09"
