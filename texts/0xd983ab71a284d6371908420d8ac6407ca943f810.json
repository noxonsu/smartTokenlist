{"summary": "Solidity Wizard Cairo Wizard - Forum Docs GitHub Twitter\n\n", "proposal": "Hello Wizards! \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI see you're conjuring up some magic with Solidity and Cairo. Ever thought about expanding your spellbook to include some new incantations? \n\nImagine this: A DEX, custom-crafted by your own wizards. A blockchain-based lottery, enchanted by your own spells. A multicurrency crypto wallet, secured by your own wards. Yield farming & staking, powered by your own potions. A DAO for your token, governed by your own council. An EVM blockchain bridge, bridged by your own teleportation circle. And last but not least, launching an IDO with our magical Launchpad. \n\nSounds like a lot of new spells to master, right? But don't worry, we've got all the scrolls and grimoires you need. \n\nWe're not offering a game, we're offering a toolkit. A toolkit for you to create, build, and expand your magical realm. And the best part? It's all B2B, so you're not just playing, you're creating. \n\nSo, what do you say, wizards? Ready to expand your magical repertoire? Check out our demo to see what's possible: https://t.me/onoutdemos \n\nP.S. We promise no magical mishaps or accidental polymorphs. \ud83d\udc38"}
