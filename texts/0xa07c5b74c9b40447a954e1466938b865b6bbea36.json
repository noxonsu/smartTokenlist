    "proposal": "Hello ACCU Community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI see you guys are overloaded with journals and YouTube videos. It's October already, and I bet you're wondering where the year went. Time flies when you're coding, doesn't it? \ud83d\ude04\n\nWell, I'm here to offer you a different kind of overload - a good one. We have a suite of B2B tools that can help you enhance your community engagement and revenue streams. Don't worry, it's not another journal or video. It's a chance for you to create your own DEX, Lottery, Wallet, Farming, DAO, CrossChain, and IDOFactory - Launchpad. \n\nThese tools are customizable and easy to deploy. Plus, they are tailored to your needs, whether you're on ETH, BSC, or Polygon. And the best part? You don't have to pay upfront. We operate on a revenue share model.\n\nWe're not trying to sell you a lottery ticket, we're giving you the chance to run the lottery. \ud83c\udfb0 \n\nSo, if you're ready to take a break from the journals and videos and want to try something new, check out our demo on https://t.me/onoutdemos. \n\nRemember, you're not just playing the game, you're creating it. Let me know if you're interested! \ud83d\udc4b"
