    "proposal": "Hello, Discover Gists community! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nWe see you've been diving deep into the world of Android permissions, CUDA installations, and even PyTorch GPU support for Mac M1. That's quite a tech stack you're building up. \n\nWe couldn't help but notice that amidst all this, there might be room for some B2B tools to make your journey smoother. We're not talking about just any tools, but ones that align perfectly with your vision and could potentially become a part of your tech stack. \n\nFrom creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2 to launching a blockchain-based lottery, we've got it all covered. And the best part? You don't have to pay a dime to deploy these tools. \n\nWe also offer tools to create a multicurrency crypto wallet, staking & yield farming, governance and proposals for your crypto token, an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and a launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nAnd remember, you're not playing here, you're creating. \n\nWe're just a message away if you're interested. Check out our demos at https://t.me/onoutdemos. \n\nP.S. If you need a tool to remove env files from git history forever, we might not have that. But hey, you've already got a gist for that! \ud83d\ude09"
