That's a game-changer! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe are all about supporting communities like yours. We have an array of B2B tools that could align with your vision and provide more opportunities for income gain. \n\nFor starters, we have a DEX tool that you can customize to your liking, from colors to commission rates. And the best part? It's a revenue share tool, meaning you don't have to pay a dime upfront. \n\nWe also have a blockchain-based lottery tool that supports multiple blockchains and tokens. Again, this is a revenue share tool, so no upfront payment required. \n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. We have a multicurrency crypto wallet, a tool to create ERC20 Staking & Yield Farming, a DAO for governance and proposals, a CrossChain tool to create an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and an IDOFactory for launchpad solutions. \n\nI know, it sounds like a lot. But don't worry, we're not trying to sell you a Swiss Army knife. We're offering a toolbox, and you get to pick the tools you need. \n\nSo, if you're interested in exploring these tools further, let's chat. We're here to support, not to sell. Check out our demos at https://t.me/onoutdemos and let us know what you think! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nP.S. Congratulations on that 1st Place at Nextype x HuboiTech GameFi Hackathon! \ud83c\udf89 That's some serious street cred right there."}
