Not just another Inu in the dog park.\" So, we're here with an offer that's as unique as your $MINIPEPE token. \n\nWe're a B2B tool shop and we've got a toolbox full of goodies that can help take Mini Pepe to the moon \ud83d\ude80 (or wherever frogs prefer to hang out). \n\nFrom creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2, setting up a blockchain-based lottery, to launching an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, we've got you covered.
