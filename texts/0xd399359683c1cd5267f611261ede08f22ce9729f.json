    "proposal": "Hello Mainstream Metaverse enthusiasts! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nWe all know that the Metaverse is like a blank canvas, waiting for us to paint our dreams onto it. We, at B2B tools, are offering you the paintbrushes. \ud83c\udfa8\n\nWe have a suite of tools that can help you create your own DEX, run blockchain-based lotteries, create a multicurrency crypto wallet, set up staking and yield farming, establish DAO governance, create an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and even launch your own IDO pools.\n\nThese tools are like LEGO blocks, but instead of building a toy house, you're building a digital empire. \ud83c\udff0\n\nAnd the best part? We're not here to sell you a lottery ticket, we're here to help you build the lottery. We're not here to play the game, we're here to help you create the game. \ud83c\udfae\n\nSo, if you're ready to take the Mainstream token to the next level, check out our demos at https://t.me/onoutdemos. Let's build something amazing together! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udd27\n\nP.S. We promise we won't make you pay in paintbrushes. \ud83d\ude09"
