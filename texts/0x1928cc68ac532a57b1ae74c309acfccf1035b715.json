    "summary": "FOUNDING IS A LAYER ONE - Welcome to Founding Layer, a revolutionary blockchain project powered by innovative Proof of Stake (PoS) technology! We proudly present an advanced blockchain solution designed to empower our global community.\n\n ABOUT FOUNDING LAYER - Founding Layer stands as the cornerstone of a new era in blockchain technology, where each block is a testament to our commitment to security, scalability, and the relentless pursuit of perfection.\n\n WHY FOUNDING LAYER? - In the Founding Layer project, we prioritize transparency, participation, sustainability, and environmental awareness. We look forward to working with you and the entire community to create a truly useful and sustainable blockchain.\n\n Enhanced Security - Security will always be our top priority. We will regularly audit our system and look for ways to improve network security.\n\n Scalability Improvement - Considering the expected growth, we will continually work to enhance network scalability to accommodate the increasing number of transactions.\n\n Application Development - In addition to the core blockchain, we will encourage the development of applications, services, and other projects that leverage the Founding Layer.\n\n Environmental Monitoring - We are committed to keeping our environmental impact to a minimum. Therefore, we will closely monitor energy consumption and the environmental footprint of our Proof of Stake network.\n\n Governance Model - We will introduce a governance model that gives token holders influence in decision-making regarding the project's development. This allows the community to participate in strategic planning and decision-making.\n\n ROADMAP - The development roadmap outlines the gradual growth and expansion of the Founding Layer, including Mainnet launch, DApp integration, and ecosystem partnerships.\n\n Idea Generation - Define the core objectives of the blockchain layer 1, such as scalability, security, and decentralization. Research existing blockchain protocols and consensus mechanisms to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Determine the target audience and use cases for the blockchain layer 1. Develop a high-level architecture and technical specifications for the blockchain layer 1.\n\n Development - Develop the core protocol and consensus mechanism for the blockchain layer 1, using the technical specifications developed in Phase 1. Implement the core protocol and consensus mechanism in a testnet environment to ensure that it is functioning correctly. Develop a wallet and node software to allow users to interact with the blockchain layer 1. Develop a smart contract language and framework to enable the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain layer 1. Create a governance system to enable stakeholders to participate in decision-making and ensure the long-term sustainability of the network.\n\n Testing & Launch - Conduct extensive testing on the blockchain layer 1, including security audits and performance testing. Launch the mainnet and migrate the testnet to the live network. Develop a robust marketing strategy to promote the blockchain layer 1 to potential users and stakeholders. Provide ongoing support and maintenance for the blockchain layer 1, including bug fixes and software updates.\n\n",
    "proposal": "Hello Founding Layer community! \ud83d\udc4b \n\nEver thought about what it would be like if your token could be the star of its own DEX or Lottery? Or perhaps you've pondered over the idea of creating a multi-currency wallet specifically for your community. Well, we've got some news for you - it's not only possible, but it's also easier than you might think! \n\nJust as Founding Layer is committed to empowering its global community through innovative PoS technology, we're here to provide you with the B2B tools you need to take that empowerment to the next level. \n\nFrom creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2, to setting up a blockchain-based lottery, we've got you covered. And the best part? It's all revenue share, so you won't have to pay a dime upfront. \n\nBut that's not all! We also offer tools for creating a multicurrency crypto wallet, ERC20 staking & yield farming, governance and proposals for your crypto token, an EVM compatible blockchain bridge, and even a Launchpad solution for IDO pools and token locking. \n\nSo, if you're ready to take your project to the next level and create some truly unique experiences for your community, let's chat! We promise, it'll be more fun than a blockchain audit. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nCheck out our demo channel for more info: https://t.me/onoutdemos \n\nRemember, you're not just playing - you're creating. Let's create something amazing together! \ud83d\ude80"
