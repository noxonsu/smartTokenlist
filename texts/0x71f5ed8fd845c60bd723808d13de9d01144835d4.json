    "proposal": "Greetings Nexus community! \ud83d\udd96\n\nI see you're all about that AI innovation life, and I must say, it's quite impressive how you're fueling advancements in the field. You're like the Tony Stark of the crypto world, except instead of building suits, you're building futures. (And hopefully not attracting any super villains!) \n\nWe've noticed that Nexus Coin serves as a catalyst for AI funding and has already provided a whopping $378,124.74 in funding to 32 businesses. That's some serious coin! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nOur B2B tool shop might just have the perfect tools to help you continue this trajectory. Imagine creating your own DEX based on Uniswap V2 or a blockchain-based lottery. All with customizable features and zero to minimal commission. \n\nAnd let's not forget about the multicurrency crypto wallet, staking & yield farming, governance for your crypto token, and a blockchain bridge. Each tool is designed to support the growth of communities like yours. \n\nAnd the best part? It's all B2B, so you're not just playing, you're creating. \n\nSo, how about it? Ready to take Nexus to the next level? Check out our demos at https://t.me/onoutdemos and let us know! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nPS: If Tony Stark were here, he'd probably say, \"I love it. 3000.\" But hey, no pressure. \ud83d\ude09"
