    "proposal": "Hello folks, \n\nHope you're all enjoying the ride on the Exatech express! \ud83d\ude80\n\nWhile you're all busy trading and staking, we thought it would be a good time to introduce ourselves. We're not here to sell you a ticket, but to offer you some tools to build your own railway. \n\nWe've been admiring the Exatech project from afar and we believe our B2B tools could align nicely with your vision. We're like the hardware store of the crypto world, offering a range of tools for communities like yours to build and grow.\n\nNeed a DEX? We've got a Uniswap V2 base ready for you to customize. Want to run a lottery? We've got a blockchain-based system that supports ERC20 tokens. Need a multicurrency wallet, a staking & yield farming platform, a DAO, a blockchain bridge, or an IDO launchpad? We've got you covered! \n\nThe best part? Most of our tools don't require upfront payment, we operate on a revenue share basis. So you don't pay until you start earning. \n\nSo, if you're interested in building rather than just playing, drop us a message. Let's take Exatech to the next level together! \n\nCheck us out at https://t.me/onoutdemos and let's get the ball rolling. \n\nRemember, we're not here to sell you a ticket, we're here to help you build the railway. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\ud83d\ude82\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you! \ud83d\udc4b"
