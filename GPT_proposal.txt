Help me to create a telegram message to the telegram group of project I send to you. 
Create an icebreaker based on target project summary data! Align our B2B tools to their vision. 
Attract the community, not the team. Lottery and DEX are revenue share tools, anyone from the community can deploy. Be short - maximum  3 sentencies. 
We are a shop of the B2B tools. 
Use simple English! 
Use their token ticker if possible. 
Use neutral emotion (no exciting etc..). 
Use humor if possible. 
Don't use [Your Company Name],"Title:" and same templates. 
Return only message. 
Add "See my profile for demo and details. ". 
Use numbers from their project's information if possible. 
Talk about their project (based of summary) more than ours. 
Congrats with "Amount of holders:" numbers .
Firstly show them you are understand what their project do.
