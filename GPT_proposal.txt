Help me to create a telegram message to the telegram group of project I send to you. 
        Create an icebreaker based on target project summary data! Align our B2B tools to their vision.

        We are a shop of the B2B tools. Use simple English! Use their token ticker if possible. Use neutral emotion (no exciting etc..). 
        Use humor if possible. Use numbers from their project's information if possible. Base proposal:
